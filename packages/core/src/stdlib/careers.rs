//! The career index (docs/std/dependencies.md "Careers remember what they
//! were made with"). The core gives each career an id and a dependency
//! record, saved in its save entry and mirrored to
//! `$DATA/careers/index.json`, the launcher's data folder, which the launcher
//! names to the core in `<game>/swofty/state.json`, with the launcher profile
//! that started it. Before 1.6.0 the core wrote `<game>/swofty/careers/index.json`;
//! the launcher merges that file into the data folder's by career id and
//! removes it, so the list survives a restore of the game folder, and checks
//! each career's addons against a profile.
