//! One multiplayer room per launcher: the server lobby, the TURN relay, the netplay bridge and
//! the game's LAN session, driven by a worker thread. The UI polls [`Session::state`].
//!
//! Creating: the game must be on its main menu; the launcher creates the room, opens the lobby
//! websocket, mints TURN credentials and allocates a relay, announces its relayed address, starts
//! the bridge (which picks `BASE`) with the room key, then tells the game `configure {self, base}`
//! and `host {category}`. Joining is the same with `join 10.77.0.1`, once this player's
//! fingerprint matches the host's and the host's relayed address is known. Members who join later
//! get a bridge port and a relay permission as the lobby reports them; when the TURN allocation
//! dies, a fresh one replaces it under the bridge, so the game keeps its `BASE`.
