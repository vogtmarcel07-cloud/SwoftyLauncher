//! Launches that fail without a crash. F1 25 runs one copy at a time: a copy
//! started while another runs finds the other's single-instance mutex and
//! closes itself, cleanly and before its window opens. To the player that
//! looks like the mods never loaded, since the copy left on screen is one the
//! launcher did not start. The session refuses to start the game while a copy
//! is running, and after a clean exit before the window it works out why the
//! game closed. What it finds is recorded here for the launcher to show and
