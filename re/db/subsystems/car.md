# car: per-car performance / setup / physics model

Owner: see `subsystems.tsv` (car-re). Scope: the live car object (`Car`) and its 23 VTF systems, the VTF load and reset
pipeline, the XOR-obfuscated values, the physics step, every system's data and runtime fields, the R&D upgrade replay,
setup, assists, damage, and the AI-only physics data. Steam build base 0x140000000, sha256 d873a1c8….

The 2026-10-28 campaign (lanes car-a object/lifecycle, car-b powertrain, car-c chassis/aero/suspension/tyres, car-d
performance/setup/assists/damage/AI) wrote this map. Struct files: `CarLive.h` and the `Car*.h` files it points at.
Real values come from the 2025 and 2026 Ferrari handling files. The copy several lanes used holds four extra upgrade
blocks from the R&D Tyres addon (`radUpgradeTyreThermal`, `radUpgradeBrakeCooling`, `radUpgradeTyreLife`,
`radUpgradePUCooling`). Everything else in it matches the stock `teams/ferrari/wep/ferrari.erp` (sha256 10883ee0…,
checked by the lead); the stock 2025 Ferrari has 18 upgrade blocks.

## Summary {#summary}

- **The car.** `CarLive` (C++ `Car`, 0x9f60 bytes, no vtable) is built once per car spawn by `Car_Chassis_Build`. It
  holds 23 systems (Engine, GearBox, FuelTank, FuelECU, BrakeECU, Chassis, Steering, CoreAero, F1Aero, Differential,
  SuspensionSystem, DebugSystem, F1Tuning, F1Assists, Turbo, EnergyRecoverySystem, ConvexHull, WheelProxies, F1Plank,
  F1WingDamage, F1SuspensionDamage, F1TyreDamage, F1BodyDamage) cached at +0x530..+0x5e0. Each system is
  `{vtable, CarLive *car at +8, allocator, data object at +0x18}` (ConvexHull keeps it at +0x20: fetch it through the
  system vt+0x38); struct offsets are reader offsets + 0x18.
- **When the VTF is read.** The `.vtf` resource is parsed once per load. Each car reads its sections once, at create.
  A reset path re-reads every section into the same systems and drops the applied upgrades (controller change,
  resettle/teleport). R&D upgrades are `radUpgrade<Type>` blocks replayed through the same readers, once per block per
  car build, scaled by progress; the game re-inits every system after each block.
- **Obfuscation.** Most handling numbers are `CarObfFloat`: two u32s 8 bytes apart, value bits = a ^ key, with a
  random 64-bit key per field per car (MT19937). Write `a = bits ^ key`. Suspension, tyre and brake records (except six Debris* XOR pairs per
  Tyre record and seven thermal XOR pairs per Brake record), ERS, Turbo, fuel mass, F1Tuning ranges and several aero
  runtime fields are plain floats.
- **Derived values.** Max torque and the limiter (Engine Init), gear tables (GearBox Reset 0x220), body drag and wing
  coefficients (F1Aero OnReset 0x80, 0x80|0x2200), mass/COM/MOI (Chassis OnReset 0x200) and brake torques per wheel
  (`Car_BrakeEcu_ApplyBias`) are derived. Edit the raw field, then re-run the owner.
- **Live knobs.** F1Aero `lift_scale` +0x19a4 and `drag_scale` +0x19a0 (plain, 1.0, applied every step), fuel mode
  (`Car_FuelEcu_SetMode_Thunk`), fuel mass (FuelTank +0x100), ERS mode (+0x1a68), tyre `UpgradeWearFactor`, the
  setup targets written by `Car_Setup_ApplyTuning`.
- **Aero outputs.** F1Aero +0x19f0 / +0x19ec are the front / rear body lift coefficients (`front_lift_coeff` /
  `rear_lift_coeff`: 0.72 / 0.96 parked, 0.79 / 1.11 at speed), not forces. +0x19e8 `total_drag` is the drag force
  in N (-2402 at speed). Seen live in T115 (#runtime).
- **Runtime (2026-10-28).** In a Grand Prix every car is built once at load (21 incl. the safety car), the whole
  grid is reset twice during loading, the player's car is reset again whenever its controller changes, and every car
  is destroyed at session end. `is_ai` (+0x124) only selects the AI physics rate; its meaning "AI-controlled right now" is NOT confirmed (see the is_ai note under #runtime). See #runtime.
- **AI.** No difficulty-keyed grip, power or drag multiplier exists. AI-only physics is data: BrakeECU ASC*AI,
  `BrakeMigrationTorqueAI`, tyre *AI downslope and slip limits, an AI tyre-wear multiplier (CarTyreState +0x84),
  and slower substep/tyre-contact rates (`Vehicle.FineUpdateRateAI`, `TyreContactSubStepCycleAI`).
- **Open (L3).** T112–T125 (see #tests); the 2026-10-28 run passed T113, T118–T120, T122 and T124, answered part of
  T112, T115, T117, T121 and T125, and deferred T116 and T123 (#runtime).

## The objects {#objects}

| object | size | where it lives | made by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CarVtfAsset` (vt `0x145c04a30`) | 0x50 | one per loaded `.vtf` resource, shared by every car built from it | `Car_Load_Vtf` 0x14475a250 (resource loader slot `0x145c04c70`) |
| `CarPhysicsRecord` (vt `0x145bf73a0`, chassis-runtime entity component) | ≥0xa08 | the vehicle entity; `[veh+0x20]` from the manager list | entity system |
| `CarLive` (cxx `Car`, no vtable) | 0x9f60 | `CarPhysicsRecord+0x58`, `g_Sess_VehicleTable[vehicle_id]` | `Car_Chassis_Build` 0x144628190 (record vt slot 7) |
| systems (one per VTF section) | per type (Engine 0x25b8) | `CarLive+0x3a0[count +0x398]`, cached by name at `+0x530..+0x5e0` | `Car_Create_<X>System`, via `Car_Systems_FindOrCreate` |
| `CarDynamics` (vt `0x145bff4d0`) | 0xa80 | `CarLive+0x900`, `+0x18` = CarLive | `Car_Chassis_Build` |

`CarPhysicsRecord` (the chassis-runtime component, vt 0x145bf73a0) also sits at `[upgrade_component+0x18]`. `CarWheelState` (old name, `CarPhysicsRecord+0x58`) is CarLive: its `+0xe8` is `vehicle_id`, not a tyre-set index, and its `+0x580` is the SuspensionSystem system. The lead should fold `CarWheelState.h` into `CarLive.h`.

Each system: `+0 vtable`, `+8 CarLive*`, `+0x10 allocator`, `+0x18` the section data object with its own 4-slot vtable `{dtor, GetName, Car_Read_<X>(node), Car_Write_<X>(node)}`. Field offsets in the lane structs are from the system pointer stored in CarLive; reader offsets are 0x18 less. Note: the first CarLive.h I wrote (11:42) said the car pointer is at system+0x18; it is at **system+0x8** (CarDynamics is the one with +0x18).

System vtable (same layout for all 23, `vt_Car_EngineSystem`): `+0 dtor`, `+8 Read(node)` (forwards to data vt+0x10), `+0x10 Write(node)`, `+0x18 OnReset(flags)` (Engine: `Car_Tuning_SetEngineBrakingAndRadiator`, Chassis: `Car_Tuning_SetChassisZCom`, GearBox: `Car_Tuning_SetFinalDrive`; called with -1 once at create = apply every setup value), `+0x20 ?`, `+0x28 GetPhaseCallback(out {fn,ctx}, phase 0..6)`, `+0x30 Init(0)` (F1WingDamage: `Car_FrontWing_Init`), `+0x38/+0x40 GetData` (= this+0x18).

System sizes (factory allocations from `[car+0xd0]`): Engine 0x25b8, GearBox 0x700, FuelTank 0x110, FuelECU 0x170, BrakeECU 0x2208, Chassis 0x450, Steering 0x140, CoreAero 0x48, Differential 0x100, SuspensionSystem 0xd8, Turbo 0x308, WheelProxies 0x80, ConvexHull 0x140, F1Aero 0x1a08, F1Assists 0x2620, F1Tuning 0x2b0, F1Plank 0x58, F1SuspensionDamage 0x140, F1WingDamage 0xd0, F1BodyDamage 0xa0, F1TyreDamage 0x288, EnergyRecoverySystem 0x1a78, DebugSystem 0x1c0. `CarSpline` is 0x2a8 bytes inline (33 uniform samples max).

## VTF pipeline {#vtf}

1. **Resource load (once per `.vtf` file).** `Car_Load_Vtf` builds `CarVtfAsset`: parses the BXML bytes into a document (`+0x10`, sized from the TSMD stats fragment when the buffer starts with `TSMD` v1), reads `Chassis/HandlingVersion` (`pro` → 100; `handlingYYYY` → clamp(YYYY, 2018, 4048) − 2017, so 2025 → 8; else 1) into `+0x18`, then registers 23 section descriptors `{name, factory}` (`Car_Vtf_AddSection_Thunk`). Nothing per-car happens here.
2. **Car create (once per car spawn).** `Car_Chassis_Build` (chassis-runtime component slot 7; the F1 subclass slot `0x1446379f0` calls it first, then checks the moving-wing nodes):
   - allocates CarLive and CarDynamics;
   - registers the car: `vehicle_id = g_Sess_VehicleCount++`, `g_Sess_VehicleTable[id] = car` (`site_Car_RegisterVehicleId`);
   - `car+0x4a8 = [[phys+0x9e8]+0x28]` (the CarVtfAsset), `car+0x9f40 = asset.handling_version`;
   - `Car_Assets_CreateSystemForPerformanceMode(asset, car+0x380)`: per descriptor, find the section node by name in the team VTF. If the car is equal-performance (`car+0x12c != 0`) and the asset has a base asset (`[asset+0x48]+0x28`), the section comes from the base VTF instead (log `Creating/resetting system using base asset for equal performance`). Then `Car_Systems_FindOrCreate` creates the system (factory) the first time and calls its `Read(node)` = `Car_Read_<X>`;
   - every system: `vt+0x30 Init(0)`, then `vt+0x28` for phases 0..6 fills the per-phase `{fn, ctx}` arrays at `car+0x4f8..+0x528` (counts `+0x4dc..+0x4f4`), then `vt+0x18(-1)` (apply setup), then `Car_Build_VtfComponents` caches the 23 pointers. `site_Car_LiveCarBuilt` (0x144629969, sig `car.live_car_built`) is the instruction after that: one hit per car, everything valid.
3. **Reset (existing car).** `Car_Reset_VehicleSystems(mgr, id, arg)` → `Car_Systems_Reset_Thunk(car+0x4a0)` → body 0x1555bdf80: runs CreateSystemForPerformanceMode again (the same system objects re-read every section from the VTF, no realloc), and destroys the applied-upgrade vector at `car+0x4c0..+0x4c8`. Callers are three `.data1` bodies: 0x148d925f0 (thunk 0x1409ed200, a per-vehicle request with the id at +0xa8), 0x1519eb350 (body of `Game_Set_VehicleController_Thunk` 0x14389cc90: changing who controls a car, e.g. player to AI, re-reads its VTF), and `Car_Physics_ResettleVehicles_Body` (0x1519ed8e0: reset, teleport the physics record to a stored pose, write `F1Assists+0x213c`, then one `Car_Physics_AdvanceCar(car, 1e-4)`). Which user actions reach it is T120. Id 0xff resets nothing in `Car_Reset_VehicleSystems`: 0x142f44fc0 (jmp 0x14f82f190), called on both paths, re-applies one vehicle's per-mode upgrade and returns at once for 0xff. The all-vehicles reset is the `.data1` function 0x14f824410 (via jmp 0x142f445d0), which calls `Car_Systems_Reset_Thunk` per car at 0x14f824536.
4. **Upgrades.** `Car_Upgrades_ApplyToVehicle(car+0x4a0, block, perc)` (career lane L2) looks up an upgrade block in the VTF document and re-runs the section readers on it. `Game_Read_VtfFloat` on an upgrade node applies its `op` to the value already stored: `mul` v·((x−1)·lerp+1), `add` v+x·lerp, `sub` v−x·lerp, `div` v/((x−1)·lerp+1), no op = overwrite (logs `Direct overwrite while upgrading`), with lerp = `g_Car_UpgradeLerp` (perc0to1). After a reset the base values come back and the upgrades have to be applied again.
5. **Teardown.** `Car_Destroy_Live` (0x14473cf70) removes the car from the table by **swap-with-last**: the last car takes the freed slot and its `+0xe8` is rewritten (`site_Car_VehicleTableRemove`, sig `car.vehicle_table_remove`).

When it runs: the VTF parse runs once per resource load; the per-car read (create) runs once per car spawn; the reset path re-reads the VTF into live systems (T119/T120 pin which game events cause which).

## XOR obfuscation and splines {#obf}

`CarObfFloat` is 16 bytes: u32 `a` at +0, u32 `b` at +8, float bits = a ^ b (the decoder reads only the low dwords). Writers draw a 64-bit key per field, `(mt() << 32) | mt()`, from `g_Car_ObfRng` (MT19937 at 0x146108c00, seeded once from QueryPerformanceCounter in `Car_Create_EngineSystem`; next = 0x143929b90; ~1000 call sites across the readers and system constructors). Encoding a new value in memory: keep `b`, write `a = bits(f) ^ b` (low dword). Some field offsets are also obfuscated in code (the store offset is decoded from a `.data1` constant, e.g. F1Plank ExtentX `0x151687bf4 ^ 0x243caf2f`, DebugSystem OverrideTyresRear `0x15218ddac + 0xb70c5131`), so a value's offset can't always be read from the reader's immediates.

`CarSpline` (`Car_Spline_EvalObfuscated` 0x142e88290): `sample_count` (+0x90) stores n-1, the last index (-1 in point mode), so the table holds [+0x90]+1 samples. ≥ 0 → uniform table: index = x·scale(+0x60) + offset(+0x70), clamped, lerp between inline samples from +0x98 (one CarObfFloat each). < 0 → point list `[+0x8, +0x10)` of 32-byte `{x, y}` CarObfFloat pairs. To change a curve in memory, re-encode every sample (or the scale/offset).

The small sections are plain floats: F1Plank (`Offset{X,Y,Z}` at system+0x2c..+0x34, `Extent{X,Y,Z}` +0x38..+0x40), WheelProxies (`CreateProxies` +0x28, `ExtraWidthFront/Rear` +0x30/+0x34), DebugSystem (`RaiseCar` +0x28, tyre override strings +0x30/+0x58). ConvexHull's offsets look like CarObfFloat pairs (L1). The SuspensionSystem records are plain floats except the XOR pairs in Tyre records (six Debris* keys, record +0x70..+0xc0) and Brake records (Density..CoolingHoleRadius, +0x30..+0x90); see #suspension.

## Physics step order {#step}

`Car_Physics_RegisterHooks_Body` (0x1552dac30) registers six callbacks into the physics world `[owner+0xe8]`, in this order (unregistered by `Car_Physics_UnregisterHooks` 0x1446439d0):

1. 0x144641510 (list 0x144458c80)
2. **`Car_Physics_PreAdvance`**: for every car in `g_Sess_VehicleTable` (it branches on count < 0x20 and pads its per-car stack arrays to 32 entries; 0x1c and 0x11 are only SIMD path thresholds), `Car_Physics_AdvanceCar(car, dt)`, sequential or through parallelForEach (`Car_Physics_AdvanceCarJob`).
3. 0x144642660 (per car: passes chassis +0x340 and chassis +0x170/+0x180 to 0x1440c2080/0x1440c2290, likely the rigid-body sync)
4. **`Car_Physics_AdvanceStage`**: phase-5 callbacks of every car, parallelForEach `Car advanceStage`
5. **`Car_Physics_RunPhase6`**: phase-6 callbacks, sequential
6. **`Car_Physics_PostVehicleUpdate`**: parallelForEach `postPhysicsVehicleUpdate` → 0x144642e20 per car

`Car_Physics_AdvanceCar(car, dt)` (0x14473fd80):

| step | what runs |
|---|---|
| phase 0 | Chassis `Car_Failsafe_LimitVelocity`, SuspensionSystem 0x1446b43d0, ConvexHull 0x14464dbe0, F1Assists `Car_PadAssist_DriftAssist`, F1Plank 0x144652e80, WheelProxies 0x14464f310 |
| 0x144741700 | called at 0x14474049c (not read) |
| phase 1 | Chassis 0x144678300, F1Aero 0x1446cb540, ERS 0x1446d1210, F1SuspensionDamage 0x1446563e0, F1WingDamage 0x1446610f0 |
| copy | chassis +0x170/+0x180 → +0x2e0/+0x2f0 (previous transform) |
| phase 2 (dt) | Engine 0x144688610, Steering 0x1446a78d0, SuspensionSystem 0x1446b4610 |
| CarDynamics | `Car_Dynamics_Update` (vt+8) once (sets substeps = max(1, (int)(dt·360)) from the setting `Vehicle.FineUpdateRate` (`g_Car_PhysicsRateHz` 0x145faa60c), or `Vehicle.FineUpdateRateAI` (0x145faa610) when car+0x124 (`is_ai`) == 1; ends with the GearBox update 0x1446a6b60 at tick dt and 0x1446db280), then `dyn+0xa4c` substeps, each calling either vt+0x10 `Car_Physics_StepVehicle` (`site_Car_DynamicsSubstep` 0x144740b66) or vt+0x18 0x1446e42c0, a reduced step without aero (0x144740b96; taken when byte 0x146ce89d8 != 0 or CarLive+0x128 == 1); then vt+0x20 `Car_Suspension_PublishWheelState` once after the loop (0x144740bb9) |
| phase 3 | SuspensionSystem 0x1446b4f10 |
| phase 4 | Chassis 0x144678660, SuspensionSystem 0x1446b4f80, FuelTank 0x14468edb0, F1TyreDamage 0x14465c610 |

Later in the tick: phase 5 (Chassis 0x1446788e0, WheelProxies 0x14464f720, F1SuspensionDamage 0x1446566b0, F1WingDamage 0x144661070, F1BodyDamage 0x1446525c0), then phase 6 (Chassis 0x14467a940, SuspensionSystem 0x1446b5550). GearBox, BrakeECU, CoreAero, Differential, Turbo, F1Tuning and DebugSystem return no phase callback: the powertrain, brakes and aero are read inside the CarDynamics substeps (`Car_Powertrain_Step`, `Car_Physics_StepVehicle`) through the CarLive pointers. FuelECU's phase slot was not checked.

Rate: the hooks run once per physics-world tick; inside, each car integrates at 360 Hz substeps (`dyn+0xa48` = dt/substeps). The rates and the tyre-contact cycles (`Vehicle.TyreContactSubStepCyclePlayer` = 1, `...AI` = 3, 0x145faa614/0x145faa618) are game settings registered by `Game_Read_VehicleConfig` 0x14463a800, so they can be changed through the settings system or by writing the globals (untested).

Class name: the live car is `Car` (`Game_Place_Vehicle` 0x14473d810 logs `Car::teleportRequest ... -> %p` with CarLive as its first argument and locks `car+0x98`, the critical section `Car_Chassis_Build` initialises). The physics owner with the six hooks is most likely `VehicleModule` (its `VehicleModule::update` string is used at 0x144643899, next to the hook functions); not confirmed.

## Vehicle table and participants {#vehicles}

- `g_Sess_VehicleTable` (0x146ce86e0) holds CarLive pointers. The writer is `Car_Chassis_Build` in `.xtls` (0x144629637..0x14462965x), so the session note "no writer in .xtls" is out of date. `Car_Physics_PreAdvance` branches on count < 0x20 and pads its per-car stack arrays to 32 entries (memsets 0x14464182c..0x144641864); 0x1c and 0x11 are SIMD path thresholds, not bounds.
- `vehicle_id` (CarLive+0xe8) is a dense slot (create order; swap-with-last on destroy). The entrants lane's `EntrantRecord+0x82` (init 0xff; the tyre-allocation note calls it the vehicle index) is the likely participant → vehicle_id link (T121).
- Runtime (2026-10-28 Grand Prix, T121): ids 0..20 in create order; id 20 is the safety car (1734 kg, no ERS, 20 systems, handling version 1), so a 20-car race has 21 CarLive objects. `is_ai` (+0x124) read 1 for every car, the player's included. Role confirmed (V8748): it selects the AI physics rate and tyre-contact cycle in Car_Dynamics_Update. NOT confirmed: "AI-controlled right now" (the "game took the idle player's car over" reading was a guess); do not use it to pick the player or tell a human from an AI car. The player's car is most likely id 19: the only one with controller-change resets and its own setup (brake pressure 0.97, 10 kg fuel in the first ApplyTuning). The participant mapping is still open.
- `CarVehicleManager` (Sess_Veh_UpdateWheelMap's object) lists per-vehicle objects at `+0x110..+0x118`; item `+0x20` = CarPhysicsRecord. `Car_Reset_VehicleSystems` uses another manager: entity list `[+0x28..+0x30]` by id, and `Car_Physics_ResettleVehicles_Body` reads physics records at `[mgr+0xb0 + id*8]` bounded by `[mgr+0x180]`, which leaves room for exactly 26 records if the array is inline (grid campaign: check).
- Upgrade component → CarLive: the career vehicle-upgrade component (`site_Career_ApplyUpgradeBlockEntry` 0x14fa63050, comp+0x28 = map<u8 type, map<u8, {progress, mass, bhp}>>, comp+0x21 flag) reaches the car as `[[comp+0x18]+0x58]`: comp+0x18 is the vehicle's CarPhysicsRecord, and the body tail-jumps to `Car_Upgrades_ApplyToVehicle(CarLive+0x4a0, block, flag, perc)` (0x14fa6316a..0x14fa6317b).
- CarLive → CarPerfVehicle / VehicleIdentity / AI config: no pointer found in CarLive in this round. The per-vehicle object in the manager list (≥0x9cb0 bytes, tyre component fields at +0x9bc0/+0x9c68) is the candidate for CarPerfVehicle (attr array +0xd10, stride 0xc40).

## Changing handling: the car object {#addon-object}

1. **Edit the VTF before load** (best): the resource is parsed once, and every create or reset reads from it. No obfuscation to deal with. Equal-performance cars read the base VTF.
2. **Write the systems after create**: hook `site_Car_LiveCarBuilt` (rdi = CarLive) or walk `g_Sess_VehicleTable`, then write fields in the systems. Spline and obfuscated coefficients need CarObfFloat re-encoding. Any reset (`Car_Systems_Reset_Thunk`) re-reads the VTF and wipes such writes, so re-apply after it (hook the thunk's return). Values derived at Init (`vt+0x30`) or setup apply (`vt+0x18(-1)`) won't follow a raw write; call the system's `vt+0x18(-1)` afterwards (needs L3).
3. **Hook the reader**: wrap a `Car_Read_<X>` (data vt+0x10) and edit after the original; this covers create, reset and upgrades. One reader is shared by every car, so filter on the system's `+8` car.
4. **Hook the step**: phase callbacks are plain `{fn, ctx}` pairs at `car+0x4f8..+0x528`. They can be swapped per car without patching code (data write; behaviour-hook rules apply). `site_Car_DynamicsSubstep` is the substep.

Needs L3: T119 (create/teardown timing), T120 (which actions reset the systems), T121 (vehicle_id ↔ participant).

## Powertrain {#powertrain}

Lane car-b. Structs `CarEngine.h`, `CarTurbo.h`, `CarGearBox.h`, `CarFuelTank.h`, `CarFuelEcu.h`, `CarErs.h`,
`CarErsMode.h`, `CarDifferential.h`, offsets from the system pointers at CarLive +0x530/+0x538/+0x540/+0x548/+0x578/
+0x5a0/+0x5a8.

### Object layout and the system vtable {#runtime}

Every powertrain component is a "system" object made by its factory (`Car_Create_<X>System`, registered by name in
`Car_Load_Vtf`):

| component | factory | alloc | system vtable | data vtable | reader (data slot +0x10) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engine | 0x1447484f0 | 0x25b8 | 0x145bfa630 | 0x145bfa1b0 | Car_Read_Engine 0x144685680 |
| GearBox | 0x144749270 -> .data1 0x1555c4f90 | 0x700 | 0x145bfb250 | 0x145bfa9e0 | Car_Read_GearBox 0x1446a39a0 |
| FuelTank | 0x144749420 | 0x110 | 0x145bfa980 | 0x145bfa8c0 | Car_Read_FuelTank_Thunk 0x14468ea90 -> 0x1554035d0 |
| FuelECU | 0x14474bf70 -> .data1 0x1555cc570 | 0x170 | 0x145bfa870 | 0x145bfa6f0 | Car_Read_FuelECU_Thunk 0x144689fb0 -> 0x1553fb310 |
| Differential | 0x1447518c0 | 0x100 | 0x145bfa120 | 0x145bfa040 | Car_Read_Differential_Thunk 0x14467ddf0 -> 0x1553d2720 |
| Turbo | 0x1447539f0 -> .data1 0x1555ded40 | 0x308 | 0x145bfbe80 | 0x145bfbdc0 | Car_Read_Turbo_Thunk 0x1446b6580 -> 0x15543fad0 |
| ERS | 0x144759840 | 0x1a78 | 0x145bfdf40 | 0x145bfdaf0 | Car_Read_EnergyRecovery 0x1446cfcd0 |

System head: +0 system vtable, +8 CarLive, +0x10 allocator, +0x18 data vtable, +0x20 data allocator, data fields
from +0x28. The reader/writer get `system+0x18`, so **struct offset = reader offset + 0x18** (e.g. Car_Read_Engine
writes Mass at +0x2f8, the struct has it at +0x310). car-a's CarComponentBase.h agrees (car at +8).

System vtable slots as used by this lane (from the vtables above and Car_Upgrades_ApplyToVehicle 0x144742c70):
- +0x08 Read(node) and +0x10 Write(node): forwarders 0x14475ab50 / 0x14475ab80 to the data object (ERS has its own
  +0x08, 0x1446d1430, same shape).
- +0x18 **Reset(flags)**. Engine = 0x1446878d0 (KB name Car_Tuning_SetEngineBrakingAndRadiator), GearBox =
  0x1446a4c20 (Car_Tuning_SetFinalDrive), FuelECU 0x14468e550, FuelTank 0x14468ed50, ERS 0x1446d0c40, Turbo
  0x1446b67f0, Differential 0x14467e010 (setup diff sliders). Flag bits seen: 0x10 engine state, 0x20 gearbox state, 0x40 refuel,
  0x200 full reset, 0x400 temperature, 0x800 PU wear, 0x1000 gearbox faults, 0x2000 re-apply setup (F1Tuning) and force
  fuel mode Standard. The resets gate on the system bit first: the Engine Reset runs nothing without 0x10 (test dl,0x10
  at 0x1446878ef), so its 0x400, 0x800 and 0x2000 need 0x10; the GearBox Reset runs nothing without 0x20 (test
  dil,0x20 at 0x1446a4c40), so its 0x1000 and 0x2000 need 0x20; the ERS Reset fires only when both 0x10 and 0x200 are
  set; the Differential Reset (0x2000) writes through car+0x578, the car's Differential, not its own this.
- +0x20 RegisterChannels: debug/telemetry channels with getter lambdas into car+0x148. The getters name the runtime
  fields (rotation_rate, rpm, temperature, wear_*, torque, energy, deploy_power, mass, ...). Every runtime field name in
  the structs comes from these strings.
- +0x28 GetPhaseCallback(out, phase): Engine phase 2 -> Car_Engine_StepInput 0x144688610; ERS phase 1 ->
  Car_Ers_StepWear 0x1446d1210; FuelTank phase 4 -> Car_FuelTank_StepBurn 0x14468edb0. GearBox, FuelECU, Turbo and
  Differential return none: they are driven from Car_Powertrain_Step.
- +0x30 Init (derived values): Engine 0x144687d60 -> 0x1553f5460.
- +0x38 / +0x40 GetData: return this+0x18.

### When values are read and when derived values are rebuilt {#load}

Readers run for the base VTF section at load and again for each `Upgrade` block. `Car_Upgrades_ApplyToVehicle`
(career lane, L2) finds `<Upgrade name=block>`, and for each child section calls that system's +0x08 Read with
g_Car_UpgradeLerp = perc0to1 and g_Car_UpgradeLerpActive = (perc != 1). After the block it calls **every** system's
+0x30 Init and then +0x18 Reset with flags `((param_3 ^ 1) << 9) | 0x20bd`. So after an upgrade replay the engine
derived values are recomputed, the fuel mode is forced to Standard (0x2000), setup sliders are re-applied, and with
param_3 == 0 the 0x200 reset also refills ERS energy and puts the gearbox in neutral. Fuel is not refilled (0x40 not
in 0x20bd).

Game_Read_VtfFloat ops (0x14464e760): `op="*"` multiply, `+` add, `-` subtract (x - v), `/` divide, `=` or no op =
overwrite (logged "Direct overwrite while upgrading"); with the lerp active `*` becomes ((v-1)p+1)x, `+` x+vp, `-`
x-vp. Missing key returns 5 and leaves the field (so the constructor default stands).

### Engine {#engine}

Data: see CarEngine.h (77 fields). Key units: RevsPowerSpline is **power in W against rotation rate in rad/s** (Ferrari
2025 peak 550060 W at 1191.5 rad/s = 11378 rpm). IdleRotationRate / LimiterRotationRate are rad/s (Ferrari 418.9 /
1371.8). Defaults come from Car_Engine_DataCtor 0x14467e900 (Mass 100, Inertia 0.3, idle 115.19, limiter 890.12,
InitialTemperature 323.15 K, wear rates 0, ...). Almost everything is a CarObfFloat; RadiatorSlipStreamFactor is
plain. EngineLayout and TurboMode are enums (TurboMode Off 0, LagSpoof 1, Full 2).

Runtime (+0x2508..+0x25b8): rotation_rate +0x2538, temperature +0x253c, kers_energy +0x2540, load +0x2544, torque
+0x2548, PU wear +0x254c ICE, +0x2550 TC, +0x2554 ES, +0x2558 MGU-H, +0x255c MGU-K, +0x2560 CE (0..1, "damage" =
max), throttle_lagged +0x2570, throttle +0x2574, engine_braking_fraction +0x252c, radiator_opening +0x25b0.

Derived (Car_Engine_Init_Body 0x1553f5460 and Car_Engine_ComputeDerived_Thunk 0x144689a70): +0x2518 max_torque =
max over the power-spline points of P x power_scale / (rad/s x revs_scale); +0x2528 limiter = LimiterRotationRate x
revs_scale; +0x2508 = power_scale x RevsPowerSpline+0x30. Both read the FuelECU active scales, and the FuelECU
Reset/SetMode re-run 0x144689a70. The power lookup itself (Car_Powertrain_Step) reads the spline live, so editing
spline samples changes power immediately; max_torque and the limiter need the re-run.

Steps: Car_Engine_StepInput (phase 2) turns the pedal into throttle (ThrottleMap splines, limiter cut with
RedLineThrottleCutTime, fuel starvation below 0.08 kg, anti-stall, legacy KERS) and writes CarLive+0x1bc.
Car_Powertrain_Step 0x1446e2290 {#powertrain-step} (called from Car_Physics_StepVehicle after the suspension solve)
computes drive torque = RevsPowerSpline(rad/s / revs_scale) x power_scale / rad/s (site_Car_EngineDriveTorque
0x1446e27a1), multiplies by Turbo efficiency_factor when TurboMode == Full, takes the braking torque from
RevsEngineBrakingSpline lerped by engine_braking_fraction and gear, and without ERS stores (drive + braking) x
throttle - braking at +0x2578. It also stores the ERS exhaust power at ERS (car+0x5a8) +0x1a2c = turbo +0x2fc x
throttle x engine speed x ExhaustPowerCoefficient (ERS +0x74) x FuelECU burn scale; that is not a fuel flow (fuel flow
is FuelTank +0x108). Param is the vehicle-dynamics system (vt_Car_Dynamics?), whose +0x18 is CarLive and
+0x80 the Engine system.

Modifiers: EnginePower = VTF block `radUpgradeEngine`: `+` on every RevsPowerSpline y (Ferrari: +388 .. +65409 W),
FuelBsfcMin x0.9, FuelBsfcMax x0.895, FuelOptimalTorque = 550, FuelTorqueLinear x1.4. Durability = `radUpgradeWearICE`
(WearICERate x0.5), `radUpgradeWearTC` (WearTCRate x0.5), `radUpgradeWearMGUH` (WearMGUHRate x0.5), `radUpgradeWearCE`
(WearCERate and WearCEDVibrationRate x0.5). Setup: engine braking and radiator sliders via Reset 0x10|0x2000. Fuel mode:
power and revs scale via FuelECU. Equal-performance mode takes sections from the base asset (car-a,
CarLive+0x12c).

### Turbo {#turbo}

Plain floats (no XOR): BoostEfficiencySpline +0x28, ZeroBarRate +0x2d0, MaxBoostRate +0x2d4, MaxBoost +0x2d8,
RelativeSize +0x2dc, Acceleration +0x2e0, Deceleration +0x2e4 (Ferrari 500/700/5.5/0.1/500/50). Runtime pressures
+0x2e8..+0x2fc, rotation_rate +0x2f8, efficiency_factor +0x304 (Reset 0x210 sets 1.0). The turbo state update itself
was not located (no phase callback; it is inside the powertrain path). No R&D block touches Turbo.

### GearBox {#gearbox}

Ratios R, N, 1st..9th as an 11-entry CarObfFloat array at +0x38 (stride 0x10), FinalDriveRatio +0x28. Shift timing,
clutch, auto-shift speed multiples, fault model (jammed/missing gear, shift-time faults) as listed in CarGearBox.h.
Runtime: gear_index +0x680 (0 R, 1 N, 2 1st), inv_total_ratio[11] +0x5fc = 1/(ratio x final drive) built by Reset
(0x20|0x200) or from setup_ratios +0x628 / setup_final_drive +0x654 when use_setup_ratios +0x540, damage +0x674,
clutch torque +0x698. Setup final drive = lerp(F1Tuning +0x198..+0x19c, slider) in Reset 0x20|0x2000. Durability:
`radUpgradeWearGearBox` DamageRateMidShift x0.5. Editing ratios after load needs Reset with 0x220 (or 0x20|0x2000), since
the step uses inv_total_ratio.

### FuelECU {#fuel-ecu}

Four tables of four modes (Lean, Standard, Rich, Max) at +0x28 (burn), +0x68 (power), +0xa8 (revs), +0xe8
(temperature), stride 0x10. Active mode +0x128 and active scales +0x130 burn, +0x140 power, +0x150 revs, +0x160
temperature (CarObfFloat). Car_FuelEcu_SetMode_Thunk 0x14468e6a0 (body 0x1553ff3d0) copies a mode in and re-runs the
Engine derived values and the GearBox table; callers 0x1432495e0, 0x14389a2b0, 0x14470d760 (T123 asks which is the
MFD). Eight functions at 0x1429xxxxx force mode 1 the same way. 2024/2025: only Lean differs (burn 0.7, power 0.9);
2026/F2: all 1.0. FuelConsumption = `radUpgradeFuelConsumption`: all four burn scales x0.85 and ERS
ExhaustPowerCoefficient x1.2.

### FuelTank {#fuel-tank}

BSFC model: FuelBsfcMax/Min, FuelOptimalRevs (rad/s), FuelOptimalTorque (Nm), FuelRevsLinear, FuelTorqueLinear,
FuelCapacity (kg, >= 0.1), COM, size, FixedLoad. Car_FuelTank_StepBurn (phase 4, gated by CarLive+0x130 bit 6): d = hypot((torque - optimal) x
TorqueLinear, (rad/s - optimal) x RevsLinear); bsfc = BsfcMin + (BsfcMax - BsfcMin) d; fuel_flow +0x108 = rad/s x
torque x bsfc x active_burn_scale x 0.001 kg/s (site_Car_FuelFlowStore); fuel_mass +0x100 -= flow x dt when
CarLive+0x132 bit 2 (site_Car_FuelMassStore), floor 0.05. Reset 0x40 fills mass = capacity x fill_fraction +0x104.
fuel_mass is plain: writing it works next step.

### EnergyRecoverySystem {#ers}

All plain floats. Common block +0x28..+0x82 (MaxDeployPower 2025 126.3 kW / 2026 350 kW, harvest and deploy lap limits
in J, EnergyStoreCapacity 4 MJ, efficiencies, MaxBrakeTorqueMGUK, MGU-H coefficients, 2026 override flags), splines
(SpeedDeploy, SpeedDeployOverride, SpeedHarvest, ChargeDeploy, wear splines), modes[4] at +0x1880 (CarErsMode: name,
gear_modifier[11] indexed by gear index, DerateStartSpeed), per-track TrackSettings +0x1980.. (read only for the
current track at load). Runtime: energy +0x19f0, lap counters +0x19c8..+0x19d0, lap_harvest_limit +0x19f4, powers
+0x1a00/+0x1a04/+0x1a14, ers_mode +0x1a68 (Reset with 0x10|0x200 = 1 Medium).
The factory leaves the energy, the lap counters and ers_mode unset, and a system created on a reset of the car's
systems with arg 1 never gets the 0x200 Reset (V2124, V2125). Core's ERS mode guard (`native/src/core/ers_mode.cpp`) hooks
site_Car_ErsGearModifierLoad and runs the system's own Reset with 0x10|0x200 when the mode is outside 0..3.

Deploy (Car_Powertrain_Step): MaxDeployPower x clamp(modes[ers_mode].gear_modifier[gear]) (site_Car_ErsGearModifierLoad
0x1446e286f) x deploy factor (track +0x1980.. when track_settings_found, else defaults +0x19a8..; mode 2 Overtake uses
0), with the speed deploy spline (override spline while +0x1a62). Wear (Car_Ers_StepWear, phase 1, gated by CarLive+0x130 bit 6; the wear part needs bit 7):
Engine wear_es and wear_mguk integrated from BaseWearRateES/MGUK, charge/speed splines, deploy ratio, CE wear penalty,
CarLive+0x9f2c and Engine+0x25a8; energy capped at capacity x ESWearCapacityModifierSpline(wear_es).

Modifiers: `radUpgradeERS` (MGU-K harvest efficiency x1.042, ExhaustPowerCoefficient x1.15, OvertakePowerEfficiency
x1.35, per-mode gear modifiers overwritten), `radUpgradeWearES` / `radUpgradeWearMGUK` (BaseWearRate x0.5),
`radUpgradeFuelConsumption` (ExhaustPowerCoefficient x1.2).

### Differential {#differential}

DriveType, RearPowerProportion, DiffRearNoEffect/FullEffect (derived inv range +0x60), DiffRearMaxLockingTorque,
DiffMidCornerGForce, DiffGForceBlendSlope, RampDifferential. DiffRearTorque is read and dropped. Runtime
rear_lock_amount +0xe0. Setup: Car_Differential_Reset_Thunk 0x14467e010 (body 0x1553d6f70), flag 0x2000, writes into the car's Differential
through car+0x578 (not its own this)
diff_off_throttle +0xec and diff_on_throttle +0xf0 as lerps of F1Tuning ranges by the setup sliders (F1Tuning +0x218 /
+0x214, logs F1_TUNING), plus three more setup values +0xf4/+0xf8/+0xfc (roles open). The diff torque code that
consumes them was not read.

### How to change powertrain handling from an addon (ranked)

1. **Edit the VTF before load** (boot): change `Engine/RevsPowerSpline`, ratios, FuelECU scales, ERS Common values in
   `teams/<team>/handling/<team>.vtf`, or the `radUpgrade*` blocks for R&D-scaled changes. Nothing to encode; derived
   values come out right. ERS TrackSettings can add per-track ERS (tools/vtf.py add_track_settings).
2. **Write the struct after build**, then re-run the owner: Engine spline samples / power: write the CarObfFloat
   (bits ^ key) and call the Engine Init (system vtable +0x30) so max_torque and the limiter follow. Gear ratios /
   final drive: write the pairs, call GearBox Reset(0x220) (0x20 must be set: the GearBox Reset does nothing without it). Fuel mode scales: write the table entry and call
   Car_FuelEcu_SetMode_Thunk with another mode then back (it returns early when the mode is unchanged), or write the
   active pairs and call Car_Engine_ComputeDerived_Thunk. Plain fields (Turbo, ERS, fuel_mass, ERS energy) take
   effect next step. Beware: any upgrade replay re-runs Reset(0x20bd) on every system.
3. **Hook the reader**: wrap Car_Read_<X> / the thunk to post-edit the data object after each read (base and every
   Upgrade block; check g_Car_UpgradeLerpActive).
4. **Hook the step**: site_Car_EngineDriveTorque (scale xmm0 = power), site_Car_ErsGearModifierLoad (deploy fraction),
   site_Car_FuelFlowStore (consumption). Each has a signature (car.engine_drive_torque, car.ers_gear_modifier_load,
   car.fuel_flow_store). All need L3 (T122-T125).

### Open (car-b)

- T122 Engine rotation_rate / throttle at site_Car_EngineDriveTorque.
- T123 who calls Car_FuelEcu_SetMode_Thunk for the player's MFD fuel mix.
- T124 fuel_mass burn identity at site_Car_FuelMassStore.
- T125 ers_mode follows the MFD ERS mode.
- PU wear writers found by a disp32 scan of .xtls (stores to Engine +0x254c/+0x2554): only the Reset, the ERS wear step,
  and three failure paths that force wear near 1: 0x1409b3cb0 (1.0), 0x1446893c0 (0.99, called from Car_Engine_StepInput),
  0x14470d760 (0.999; now named Car_State_Read_Snapshot (2026-11-11, car-re): a per-car snapshot deserializer that also forces engine wear,
  calls Car_FuelEcu_SetMode_Thunk and restores CarErs.ers_mode and the F1Aero drs_flags bits).
- Not covered: where career PU wear (engine_management) is loaded into the six wear fields (no plain store found),

### Layout of a component system {#layout}

Every system is `{+0 system vtable, +8 CarLive *car, +0x10 allocator, +0x18 data object}` (CarComponentBase). The data
object has its own 4-slot vtable `{dtor, GetName, Car_Read_<X>, Car_Write_<X>}`; a reader's `param_1` is the data
object, so **system offset = reader offset + 0x18**. Proven per component by the constructor writing the data vtable
at +0x18 and by the runtime readers using the +0x18-shifted offsets:

The system vtable slot +0x18 is **OnReset(sys, flags)** (Chassis: `Car_Tuning_SetChassisZCom` 0x144676d40, F1Aero:
`Car_F1Aero_OnReset` 0x1446c9680). Derived values live there, so the flags decide whether a raw edit reaches the sim.

For car-a: `CarLive.h` notes say a component keeps the car at component+0x18; the code reads it at **system+8**
(`[F1Aero+8]+0x568` in StepVehicle, ctor `puVar[1] = param_1`), which matches `CarComponentBase.h`. The +0x18 slot is
the data vtable.

XOR keys: every CarObfFloat key is drawn per instance at construction (Chassis ctor calls 0x143929b90 on RNG
0x146108c00 for each pair), so keys differ per car and per session. Encode with the live key: `a = bits(f) ^ [p+8]`.

### F1Aero {#f1aero}

**Data (CarObfFloat, VTF F1Aero/*)**: front/rear cl maps `m_aero_{front,rear}_cl_{maxf,minf}_{maxr,minr}`,
`m_aero_{front,rear}_wing_loss`, AeroReference*, ride-height clamps `m_aero_{min,max}_{front,rear}_height`, slipstream
scales, `m_aero_wing_{front,rear}_{drag,force}`, 8 splines (ForceVelocityMultiplier, Rear/FrontCoeffLiftVsRideHeight
with fallback keys Rear/FrontForceRideHeightMultiplier, ...VsChassisRake, Rear/FrontForceDirectionMultiplier,
DistanceDrivenCumulativeDRSFailureChance), Front/RearCoeffLiftMultiplier (sys+0x1708/+0x1718), BodyDragCoeffMin/Max
(aliases m_aero_cd_min/max, sys+0x1728/+0x1738), Num{Front,Rear}WingSettings (u32), wing CoL0-2/CoD0-2, damage mults,
DRS, centre of drag, side/top drag, brake duct and radiator lift/drag (sys+0x18e8..+0x1948), AdjustableFrontWing bool.
Defaults when a key is missing: the reader keeps the current value (Game_Read_VtfFloat leaves the out param alone).

**Derived at reset (`Car_F1Aero_OnReset`)**: the whole body runs only when flag bit 0x80 is set (test dil,dil; jns at
0x15546100b to the epilogue): the 0x200, 0x1000 and 0x2200 branches and the +0x19ac clear all sit inside that test, so
without 0x80 the call does nothing. It copies decoded BodyDragCoeffMin/Max to +0x1960/+0x1964 and the
eight cl-map values to +0x1968..+0x1984 (plain floats); flag 0x2200 computes the wing terms from the integer wing
settings s (+0x19b4 front, +0x19c0 rear): `lift = CoL0 + CoL1*s + (CoL2*s)^2`, same for drag, into +0x19b8 (front
lift), +0x19bc (front drag), +0x19c4 (rear lift), +0x19c8 (rear drag); flag 0x1000 zeroes wing damage and sets
drag_scale +0x19a0 and lift_scale +0x19a4 to 1.0; flag 0x200 resets DRS state.

**Per step (`Car_Physics_StepVehicle` 0x1446dceb0)**, sys = [car+0x570]:
- ride-height ratios from Car_F1Aero_GetFront/RearRideHeight (0x1446cb000 / 0x1446cb260, handling_version >= 7) or
  the wheel heights (older), normalised by the min/max height clamps. Each getter takes per wheel plane - (wheel+0x168 +
  [wheel+0x140]+0x15e4) - clamp01(wheel+0x248 - wheel+0x168) (plane = AeroReferencePlaneHeight sys+0x78), averages per
  axle (rear = SuspensionSystem +0x70/+0x78, front +0x80/+0x88), then extrapolates by AeroReferenceOffsetRear/FrontZ
  over the axle z gap and clamps.
- rear body lift coefficient +0x19ec `rear_lift_coeff` (store 0x1446dda91) = (BrakeDuctRearCoeffLift x
  mean(RL,RR wheel+0x130) + RadiatorOpeningRearCoeffLift + cl-map/curve terms) x RearCoeffLiftMultiplier x lift_scale.
- front body lift coefficient +0x19f0 `front_lift_coeff` (store 0x1446ddda4) = same with the Front keys x (1 -
  FrontCoLByWingDamageMult x front_wing_damage(+0x199c)): the damage term is a factor, not a subtraction. **The older
  inbox note had +0x19ec as front: it is rear.**
- These two are coefficients, not forces (T115, 2026-10-28): the player car read 0.72 / 0.96 (front / rear) parked
  and 0.79 / 1.11 at speed, front share about 0.43; the other cars 0.56..0.82 / 0.88..1.13. They were named
  front_downforce / rear_downforce before the run. The store sites themselves were not traced (the values come from
  gdb snapshots), so `site_Car_AeroStore*` stay L2.
- slipstream: lift x (k + (1-k) x CoreAero+0x30) with k = m_aeroSlipStreamAirDensityScaleLift.
- total lift +0x19e4 (store 0x1446ddf0d) = body front + rear + front wing term x (1-front_wing_damage) x
  ((m_aero_wing_front_force-1) x wing_open + 1) + rear wing term x (1-rear_wing_damage(+0x1998)) x
  ((m_aero_wing_rear_force-1) x wing_open' + 1); wing_open = +0x19a8, wing_open' = 0 when +0x19ac is set.
- total drag +0x19e8 (store 0x1446de114) = (lerp(+0x1960, +0x1964, ratio) + BrakeDuct*CoeffDrag x wheel+0x130 +
  RadiatorOpeningCoeffDrag) x drag_scale x (1 + front_wing_damage x BodyCoDByWingDamageMult) + wing drag terms
  (rear one blended by m_aero_wing_rear_drag, which radUpgradeDRS multiplies by 0.9). No reader of +0x19e8 was found
  (the +0x19e8 reads at 0x142948f81/0x14296dbe2 are another object). It is the drag force in N, not a coefficient:
  about 0 parked and -2402 at speed for the player car (T115); total lift +0x19e4 read about 0 parked and -7720 at
  speed.
- getters 0x1446ca5f0 (total downforce, x1.5 factors) and siblings 0x1446caa40/0x1446cab60/0x1446cacc0 (balance).

### Chassis {#chassis}

Data: Mass, MOIX/Y/Z, COMY, COMZ, FFBScale, Front/RearVisualHeightOffset (CarObfFloat), CarCode,
CarHandlingVersionName, TyrePhysicsGroup (strings), sqrt(Mass) derived **inside the reader** (+0x98).
OnReset (`Car_Tuning_SetChassisZCom`, chassis vtable +0x18): flag 0x2000 sets live COM z +0x158 =
lerp(F1Tuning COM-Z range, slider) ("Setting chassis z-com"); flag 0x200 pushes COM (COMY, +0x158) into the body
(0x144676a80), mass +0x150 = sqrt_mass^2, inv mass +0x154, MOI +0x160..+0x168. The rigid body uses these, so a raw
Mass/COM/MOI edit needs OnReset(0x200) (or direct writes of +0x150..+0x168). At runtime +0x150 also carries the fuel:
it read VTF Mass + FuelTank.fuel_mass (816.21 = 803 + 13.217 on the grid, 815.76 = 803 + 12.766 later; T118), so
something adds the fuel after OnReset (writer not mapped yet).

### CoreAero {#coreaero}

SlipStreaming (+0x28) and SlipStreamWhileBraking (+0x29) bools, ctor 1; +0x30 wake density ratio (ctor 1.0) that
F1Aero multiplies into lift (and drag). +0x40 byte ctor 0xff (probably the car being followed).

### Steering {#steering}

MaxSteeringLock, AckermannSteering, VisualTurnRate and the damage-wobble block, CarObfFloat from +0x28. The VTF
`Upgrade[very_high]` block raises MaxSteeringLock to 0.41 and AckermannSteering to -0.04363 (an assist-level block,
not R&D). Consumers not traced this round.

### BrakeECU {#brakeecu}

12 ABS/ATC splines (front variants fall back to the unsuffixed key), brake torques BrakeFront/Rear (2025: 3105/2295
N m) and the Backwards/Forwards variants, BrakeMigrationTorque and an **AI-only BrakeMigrationTorqueAI**, BrakePressure,
ATC/ABS/ASC strengths (with *AI variants) as CarObfFloat; the (de)activation rates, ABSSymmetryFactor,
PunctureThrottleMax, BurstThrottleMax are plain floats. `Car_BrakeEcu_ApplyBias` 0x144676250 turns bias +0x21d8 (0..1)
and pressure +0x21dc into per-wheel max brake torque (CarWheel+0xf8, CarObfFloat): bias 0.5 gives BrakeFront/BrakeRear,
lower bias blends towards the *Backwards pair, higher towards *Forwards, all x pressure. Live brake strength edits:
write the wheel torques, or the BrakeECU torques and re-run ApplyBias.

### SuspensionSystem, wheels {#suspension}

The reader fills per-name records with **plain floats**, except the XOR pairs (decoded with [+8]): Tyre records hold six
(DebrisPunctureMin/MaxSpeed, DebrisPunctureProbabilityAtMin/MaxSpeed, DebrisPunctureInvulnerabilityPeriod,
DebrisNextGenPunctureProbabilityMultiplier at record +0x70..+0xc0) and Brake records seven (Density, Conductivity,
RotorOutside/InsideRadius, RotorThickness, SurfaceLayerThickness, CoolingHoleRadius at +0x30..+0x90). numXTypes only
bounds the child loop. Tyre[name] (`CarSuspTyreType`: mass, inertia,
width, radius, grip multipliers, puncture block, UpgradeWearFactor +0x630, UpgradeTempFactor +0x634, downslope
factors +0x638..+0x64c, temperature-wear factor +0x654/+0x658), Brake[name] (`CarSuspBrakeType`: handbrake, heat
capacity, heat transfer coefficients, damage), Suspension[name] (`CarSuspCorner`: camber/castor/toe, steer pivot,
8 Height* splines, rest/render positions, Min/MaxHeight, RestLength, RideHeight, bump stops, RideHeightOffset,
Wheel*Factor, RollCentre, SpringConstant, ThirdSpring*, Slow/FastBump/Rebound damping, AntiRollConstant). Record
pointers: tyre types sys+0x38, brake types +0x48, suspension types +0x58 (two each, order = VTF order; 2025 VTFs list
Rear first). Wheels sys+0x70 RL, +0x78 RR (rear axle object +0x90), +0x80 FL, +0x88 FR (front axle +0x98), 0x480
bytes each. The two 0x1670 axle objects (`CarSuspAxle`, +0x90 with wheels 0/1, +0x98 with wheels 2/3) look like an
8-byte head plus a copy of the corner record (StepVehicle reads axle+0x15e4 = RideHeightOffset). Setup
(`Car_Tuning_SetSuspension` 0x1446a7be0, only under flags & 0x2000) writes live camber axle+0x1650, toe +0x1654 and
anti-roll constant +0x1664, choosing the rear axle by LocalRestPositionZ <= 0 (axle+0x1598). One call does one axle's
set (rear when its own axle +0x1598 <= 0, else front; front camber slider +0x228); .data1 0x15543f450 calls it for
[susp+0x90] then [susp+0x98]. Springs, dampers and ride height are not set
there; their setup path and the consumers of SpringConstant/damping are not mapped yet.

### Tyres {#tyres}

- Per-wheel tyre object (`CarTyreState`), four at physics-vehicle +0x60/+0x68 (rear) /+0x70/+0x78 (front):
  +8 TyreType record, +0x10 car, +0x8c wetness, +0xc0 compound runtime, +0xd0 wheel index, +0x88 wear 0..1.
- **Grip**: `Car_Suspension_SolveWheels` calls `Car_Tyre_GripScale` (handling_version > 6) and
  `Car_Tyre_MagicFormula` per wheel. GripScale = max(DownslopeScaleMinimum, wet loss x speed loss), using **AI-only
  factors** (+0x63c/+0x644) when car+0x124 == 1. Magic Formula curve = compound+0x1438 (load rows lerped by load;
  camber GripGain only at 0). Car_Parse_TyreModel precomputes, per load row, the slip angle of peak force (step search
  over 9 Magic Formula calls) into row+0x1c and curve+0x210; a live edit of Peak/UpSlope/DownSlope/Shape changes the
  force at once but leaves that peak slip stale until the compound is parsed again.
- **Wear** (`Car_Tyre_UpdateWear` 0x1446b79f0, from Car_Tyre_Step 0x1446b5720): inc = (AI ? obj+0x84 : 1) x
  obj+0x80 x UpgradeWearFactor x temperature factor x wetness spline x lerp(WearRateMin, WearRateMax, pressure
  ratio) x work / 1e6. radUpgradeTyreWear multiplies UpgradeWearFactor by 0.825 (scaled by progress), so it acts on
  every wear step with no re-init. AI cars get an extra multiplier the player never sees.
- **Temperature**: `Car_Tyre_UpdateTemperature` 0x1446b7b70 (UpgradeTempFactor read at 0x1446b7e1f); not mapped.
- VCMPD compound keys (Wear, Temperature, Pressure, Wetness, Residuum, TyreModel MNC ParametricData) are read by
  Car_Parse_TyreModel 0x144743900 with plain floats; only the pressure/wear-rate fields used by the wear step are
  placed in `CarTyreCompound.h` (L1). Compound switching (Car_Tyre_ChangeToNextCompound, ActivateCompounds) not read.

### R&D and other modifiers {#modifiers}

R&D attributes are VTF `Upgrade[radUpgrade*]` blocks replayed through the same Car_Read_<X>; Game_Read_VtfFloat in
upgrade mode applies `*`: v x ((k-1)p+1), `+`: v + k p, `-`: v - k p, `/`: v / ((k-1)p+1), p = progress 0..1.
Stock 2025 blocks in my lane:

| attribute | block ops | lands in | takes effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| FrontDownforce | FrontCoeffLiftMultiplier x1.26, FrontWingCoL1 x1.1 | F1Aero +0x1708, +0x1768 | multiplier: next step; CoL1: OnReset 0x2200 |
| RearDownforce | RearCoeffLiftMultiplier x1.26, RearWingCoL1 x1.1 | +0x1718, +0x17d8 | same |
| Drag | BodyDragCoeffMin x0.87, Max x0.89, Front/RearWingCoD1 x0.94/0.93 | +0x1728/+0x1738, +0x1798/+0x1808 | OnReset 0x80 / 0x2200 |

| TyreWear | Tyre[Front/Rear] UpgradeWearFactor x0.825 | TyreType +0x630 | next wear step |
| Brakes | BrakeFront/Rear/Backwards/Forwards x1.4 | BrakeECU +0x2008..+0x2058 | when Car_BrakeEcu_ApplyBias 0x144676250 re-runs (writes wheel+0xf8) |

AI-only physics values found: BrakeMigrationTorqueAI, ASC*AI, SlipRatio*LimitAI, Wetness/SpeedDownslopeFactorAI and
the AI tyre-wear multiplier (CarTyreState+0x84). No AI grip/power/drag multiplier on the aero path.

### How to change handling from an addon (ranked) {#addon-chassis}

1. **Edit the VTF/VCMPD before load** (the rnd-tyres pattern): base values, plain-float suspension/tyre records, and
   new Upgrade blocks. No obfuscation, no re-init, works for every car using that package.
2. **Write the live struct after build**: plain-float records (CarSuspTyreType, CarSuspCorner, CarSuspBrakeType) and
   the F1Aero plain runtime fields (lift_scale +0x19a4, drag_scale +0x19a0, wing terms +0x19b8..+0x19c8) take effect on
   the next step; CarObfFloat fields need the live key; BodyDragCoeff*, wing Co*, Chassis Mass/COM/MOI need the
   component's OnReset (system vtable +0x18) with flag 0x80 / 0x80|0x2200 / 0x200 (F1Aero does nothing without 0x80), or the derived copies written directly.
   Note OnReset 0x80|0x1000 resets lift_scale/drag_scale to 1.0, so a write there must be repeated after resets. No
   other writer of +0x19a0/+0x19a4 was found in .xtls, so these two plain floats are the cleanest per-car
   downforce/drag knobs (T115 checks the store sites they feed).
3. **Hook a reader**: Car_Read_<X> runs for the base section and every Upgrade block; post-hook it to rescale.
4. **Hook the step**: MidHooks at site_Car_AeroStoreFront/RearDownforce, TotalLift, TotalDrag; a function hook on
   Car_Tyre_GripScale (return value = per-wheel grip multiplier). Not on Car_Tyre_UpdateWear (XOR-masked lea at
   0x1409d5443, see #addon); these sites miss cars on the vt+0x18 substep path.

Needs L3: T115 (downforce stores and front/rear naming), T116 (wing_open_fraction = DRS), T117 (tyre wear field),
T118 (live chassis mass after R&D).

### Cross-lane notes (car-c) {#lanes-c}

- car-a: component car pointer is system+8 (see #layout); CarLive fields seen here: +0x124 (== 1 selects every *AI
  tyre/brake value, so it is the AI flag), +0x128 (== 1 skips tyre wear), +0x132 bit 7 (tyre wear enabled), +0x88/+0x8c
  (divide the MF load before the formula). The physics vehicle passed to StepVehicle/SolveWheels has car at +0x18 and
  the four CarTyreState pointers at +0x60..+0x78; its +0x170..+0x17c are per-wheel heights.
- car-d: tyre wear setting: Car_Tyre_SetWearFactor 0x142ea2300 ("Wear factor set to %f on vehicle %d") is the likely
  writer of CarTyreState+0x80 (wear_scale); AI wear multiplier CarTyreState+0x84 is the place an AI-difficulty tyre
  model would land. Setup: Chassis COM-Z slider is F1Tuning +0x210 (0..1) lerped over the F1Tuning vtable +0x40 range.
- lead: `Game_Read_VtfSuspensionSystem` 0x1446aa090 is now `Car_Read_SuspensionSystem` (subsystem car).
  `Car_Parse_Chassis` 0x14462e6d0 is not the Chassis VTF reader (it registers collision callbacks); the reader is
  `Car_Read_Chassis` 0x144676730. The inbox line "front downforce F1Aero +0x19ec, rear +0x19f0" is swapped.

## Performance, setup, assists, damage and AI {#apply}

Lane car-d. Structs `CarPerfVehicle.h` (the career Upgrades object), `CarTuning.h`, `CarSetupValues.h`, `CarAssists.h`,
`CarDamageFrontWing.h`, `CarDamageSuspension.h`, `CarDamageBodyPart.h`.

### Performance chain: R&D attribute -> physics {#perf}

The R&D attribute names (EnginePower, FuelConsumption, FrontDownforce, ...) never index a physics
array. The chain is:

1. Career side (career lane, already L2): `upgrade_type` string -> type id 0..18 (name table
   0x14584f6b8) -> per-type progress 0x143526260 -> `Game_Rnd_FillVehicleUpgrades` 0x141238cb0 puts
   `map[type][0] = {progress, mass, bhp}` into the vehicle upgrade component (comp+0x28) ->
   0x14fa4deb0 -> 0x14fa63050(comp, type) names the block `radUpgrade<X>` from
   `k_Career_UpgradeBlockNameTable` 0x145803ce4 and tail-jumps to `Car_Upgrades_ApplyToVehicle`
   (0x144742c70) with rcx = CarLive+0x4a0, rdx = block name, xmm3 = perc = clamp(sum progress).
2. `Car_Upgrades_ApplyToVehicle(CarLive+0x4a0, name, flag, perc)` (decomp re/decomp/144742c70.c):
   - picks the asset: CarLive+0x4a8 `vehicle_asset`; when `CarLive.equal_performance` (+0x12c) == 1
     it uses the base asset `[asset+0x48]+0x28` instead (so equal-performance cars all replay the
     base car's blocks).
   - returns 0 at once when the block name is already in the applied-blocks vector
     (CarLive+0x4b8, begin +0x4c0, end +0x4c8, stride 0x28, name at +0x10): **a block is applied at
     most once per car build**; re-applying with a new perc does nothing until the systems are
     rebuilt.
   - walks the VTF root's `Upgrade` children (vt+0x20 child iterator, attribute `name`) for the one
     whose name matches (case-insensitive), pushes the name onto the applied vector, then for every
     section of the asset's section list (asset+0x30..+0x38, stride 0x40, name at +0x10) finds the
     same-named child of the block and the CarLive system whose type name matches
     (`systems[i]` vt+0x38 -> type, type vt+8 -> name), and calls the system's vt+0x08 with the
     section node while the globals `g_Car_UpgradeLerp` (0x145faa650, float, = perc) and
     `g_Car_UpgradeLerpActive` (0x146ce88a0, byte, = perc != 1.0) are set; both are reset to 1.0 / 0
     right after.
   - after the replay, for every system: vt+0x30(flag) then vt+0x18(0x20bd | (!flag << 9)). This is
     the re-init that recomputes derived values; **the game re-runs it itself after each block**.
3. The system's vt+0x08 runs its section reader (`Car_Read_<X>`, data-class slot 2), which reads
   every key by name through `Game_Read_VtfFloat` 0x14464e760. Keys missing from the block keep the
   current value (the reader decodes the XOR pair, lets Read_VtfFloat modify it, re-encodes).
   `Game_Read_VtfFloat(node, name, float *inout)` (decomp re/decomp/14464e760.c), key `<name value=v op=c>`:

   | op | lerp inactive (perc == 1 or base load) | lerp active (perc != 1) |
   |---|---|---|
   | `*` | x = v * x | x = ((v-1)*perc + 1) * x |
   | `+` | x = x + v | x = v*perc + x |
   | `-` | x = x - v | x = x - v*perc |
   | `/` | x = x / v | x = x / ((v-1)*perc + 1) |
   | `=` or no `op` | x = v (logs "Direct overwrite while upgrading" when lerp active) | same: NOT lerped |
   | other char | x unchanged, returns 0 | same |
   Missing key: returns 5, logs `Float "%s" NOT found.` (VEHICLE_ASSETS), x unchanged.

   Because ops apply to the current value, the order is base section -> each radUpgrade block once.

#### Which physics field each R&D attribute moves (2025 Ferrari, stock blocks)

| upgrade type / block | section/key | op, full-upgrade value |
|---|---|---|
| EnginePower `radUpgradeEngine` | Engine/RevsPowerSpline (15 vertices, replaced); FuelTank/FuelBsfcMin x0.9, FuelBsfcMax x0.895, FuelOptimalTorque = 550 (set, not lerped), FuelTorqueLinear x1.4 | spline + `*` |

`Upgrade[very_high]` (Steering MaxSteeringLock = 0.41, AckermannSteering = -0.04363) is a non-R&D
block. The setup path 0x14f82f2b3 calls ApplyToVehicle with perc 1.0 and names from table
0x145803c68 (career lane: those names never match a block-name pointer; the VTF block name is
compared as a string, so a matching string name would still apply).

Mass and power reach the car through these blocks too. `Car_Upgrades_CalcNonLinearMass` 0x143535480
(decomp re/decomp/143535480.c) is a separate estimate {#mass}: on the team's Upgrades object
(CarPerfVehicle.h), linear = sum over type metadata records (+0x1a38..+0x1a40, stride 0x20: +0 type,
+4 mass at full) of mass_at_full * progress(type) (helper 0x1435352a0 -> Game_Rnd_CalcUpgradeTypeProgress);
f = linear / sum(mass_at_full); result = linear + f*(f*target - linear), target = Upgrades+0x50. Callers:
0x142f5a5d0 (adds FuelTank+0x100 fuel mass and Chassis Mass, XOR Chassis+0x98/+0xa0, then a lap-time-
style estimate 0x1429028f0: strategy / pace prediction) and 0x142962f10 (garage/programme UI). It does
not write the physics mass.

#### CarPerfVehicle correction
The "attribute array at +0xd10, stride 0xc40, count +0x1960" is the career `Upgrades` object's
UpgradeTree array: trees at +0xe0 (stride 0xc40), list at tree+0x30 (+0x110), count at tree+0xc30
(+0xd10), tree count +0x1960 (`site_Car_AttrArrayBase` loads rbx = r12+0xd10, the count, and the list is
rbx-0xc00). Rewritten in `structs/CarPerfVehicle.h`.

#### Performance mode {#perf-mode}
`Car_Assets_CreateSystemForPerformanceMode(asset, CarLive+0x380 container)` 0x144742790 (callers:
`Car_Chassis_Build` 0x1446296e6, .data1 0x1555bdf97) walks the asset's section list; for each section,
when `CarLive.equal_performance` (+0x12c) != 0 it takes the section from the base asset
(`[asset+0x48]+0x28`, "Creating/resetting system using base asset for equal performance") else from the
team VTF ("... for realistic performance"), and creates/resets the system with
`Car_Systems_FindOrCreate` 0x144759eb0. So equal performance swaps whole VTF sections (and the upgrade
blocks, step 2 above) for the base car's, at system build. `performance_class` / `performance_tier`
are read into the AI-config object (VehicleIdentity +0xcda/+0xcdb, entrants lane); class is the
candidate-pool car-class filter (session lane); no physics reader of the tier was found statically.

### Setup: F1Tuning {#tuning}

`structs/CarTuning.h` is the F1Tuning system (CarLive+0x590) with system-pointer offsets: data object at +0x18
(plain-float Min/Max ranges, struct offset = reader offset + 0x18), slider fractions from +0x210. Slider block:
`structs/CarSetupValues.h`. In the table below the CarTuning ranges are READER (data) offsets; add 0x18 for the
struct, e.g. DifferentialOnThrottleMultipleMin is reader +0x18 = CarTuning+0x30.

`Car_Setup_ApplyTuning(setupMgr, u64 *skipMask, setup)` 0x140c11550 (decomp re/decomp/140c11550.c):
car = setupMgr+0x28; tuning = car+0x590; slider block = setup+0xb0 if byte setup+0x158 else setup+0x08.
Per slider (skipped when its mask bit is set): fraction = clamp(step / stepCount, 0, 1) where stepCount
is the int at +8 of a per-slider global object (0x14605a6d8, 0x14605a700, 0x14605a728, 0x14605a730, ...);
the fraction is stored on the tuning system and the target field is lerp(Min, Max, fraction) from CarTuning:

Ends with `0x1446b1ba0(SuspensionSystem)` (thunk to .data1 0x15543dfd0): suspension recompute after the
axle fields change. 10 callers of ApplyTuning (0x140c0a636, 0x140c0ab80, 0x140c0af2d, 0x140c108de,
0x140c11272, 0x140c113f4, 0x142a4165e, 0x142f44bf1, 0x142f44f7f, 0x142f45554), the setup manager and
session code. Setup presets: `Car_Load_SetupPreset` 0x140c04fd0 (car_setup.presets rows, ai/player
variants), car lane L1 from derived-keys.

How to change setup from an addon: (1) edit the F1Tuning ranges in the VTF (boot); (2) write
CarTuning Min/Max (plain floats, no XOR) and call ApplyTuning again (or let the next setup change call
it); (3) write the target fields directly after ApplyTuning (Differential+0xec..+0xfc, axle
+0x1650/+0x1654/+0x1664, BrakeECU+0x21d8.., Engine+0x252c, Chassis+0x158) then call 0x1446b1ba0 for the
suspension; (4) hook ApplyTuning's entry with a modified slider block (mask bits pick which apply).

### Assists: F1Assists {#assists}

`structs/CarAssists.h` (system offsets; the offsets in this paragraph are reader offsets, struct = +0x18). Reader `Car_Read_F1Assists` 0x1446cb880 (was `Car_PadAssist_LoadSteeringSplines`,
data-class vtable 0x145bfcbe0 slot 2), writer 0x1446cc750 (slot 3). Twelve 0x2a8-byte splines from +0x10
(pad steering rate vs speed, lock, traction control Throttle*VSRearPeakSlip{Ratio,Angle}Proportion,
ABS BrakeVSRearPeakSlipRatioProportion, wet variants, drift assist) and XOR-pair scalars from +0x1ff0
(MinimumSteeringLock, SteerDeadzone, SteerOut/InMultiple, ..., WheelInertia). Then name-formatted loops
for SteerModel{Speed,MaxLock,SteerInertia,InputStiffness,CounterSteerStiffness}0..2. Consumers:
`Car_PadAssist_DriftAssist` 0x1446cd9a0 and the pad-assist steering code (car lane L1). The BrakeECU also
carries ABS/TC splines (car-c). Assist toggles (TC off/medium/full, ABS on/off) select which curve is
used at runtime; the flag reads were not reached this round.

### Damage {#damage}

| system | data struct | reader / writer | storage |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1WingDamage (CarLive+0x5c8) | `CarDamageFrontWing.h` (data at +0x18: struct +0x28..+0x38) | 0x14465f580 (thunk to .data1 0x1553794c0) / 0x14465f450, vtable 0x145bf9030 | plain floats +0x10..+0x20 |
| F1SuspensionDamage (+0x5d0) | `CarDamageSuspension.h` (system offsets; reader offsets below) | 0x1446533e0 / 0x144653070, vtable 0x145bf8af0 | XOR pairs +0x10..+0x58, plain fracture limits +0x60/+0x64, linkage list |
| F1BodyDamage (+0x5e0) | `CarDamageBodyPart.h` (per part) | 0x144650010 / 0x14464fe90, vtable 0x145bf89a0 | per part: name, MaxDamage (int), AeroLoss +0x2c, DragGain +0x30, CoolantLoss +0x34 |
| F1TyreDamage (+0x5d8) | (car-c / tyre deformation) | `Car_Write_F1TyreDamage` 0x144657040, `Car_TyreDeformation_LoadNodeGraph` 0x144657290 | 1012 keys, mostly the deformation node graph |

Front wing runtime (`structs/CarDamageFrontWing.h`, the F1WingDamage SYSTEM at CarLive+0x5c8 =
game::FrontWing; its +0x28..+0x38 are the data object's SpeedThreshold..FullDetachScale): `Car_FrontWing_OnCollision` 0x14465fdc0 (L2) is gated by **CarLive+0x130 bit 0**
(collision damage on) and writes the aero factor F1Aero+0x199c = clamp((left+right)/max) only when
**CarLive+0x130 bit 1** is set; these two bits are the damage-setting switches to look at first (who sets
them is open). Damage = surface x +0x40 (impact divisor) x impulse x +0x2c. Left +0x48 / right +0x4c clamp at +0x38, side broken at +0x34 (visual state in 0x144631a50),
chassis damage +0x50. The engine power-factor function 0x1446db280 sets a "wing gone" bool from
[+0x54]/[+0x38] >= 1.

Earlier KB rows (L1): `Car_FrontWing_OnCollision` 0x14465fdc0 adds damage to the front
wing (fw+0x48/+0x4c, max +0x38) and to F1SuspensionDamage +0x138/+0x13c, and writes the damage ratio to
F1Aero+0x199c (front wing factor; rear +0x1998). `Car_State_Read_Snapshot` (was Car_TyreDamage_Update) 0x14470d760 reads TyreDmg,
BodyDmg, WingDmg and F1Aero. The body part AeroLoss/DragGain are the per-part downforce loss and drag
gain at full damage; their aero consumer is the next target (search the F1Aero step for the part list).

To change damage behaviour: edit the VTF sections (boot); or write the data fields (XOR-encode the
suspension ones); `F1WingDamage/DamageScale` and the per-part AeroLoss/DragGain are the knobs.

#### Detachable parts {#parts}

car-re, 2026-10-28, Steam build, read from the decompiles of 0x14465f620, 0x144660400 (with its `.data1` body
0x15537d4f0), 0x1446612a0 (body 0x15538e460), 0x144661440, 0x1446686d0 and the three predicates. This is the
data flow behind `car.parts.register`.

`Car_FrontWing_Init` (0x14465f620, L2) is slot 6 (+0x30 Init) of the F1WingDamage system vtable 0x145bf90a0
(pointer at 0x145bf90d0). It has no direct callers. `Car_Chassis_Build` calls every system's +0x30 with 0 at
0x14462973d, and `Car_Systems_Reset_Body` calls it with its own reset argument at 0x1555bdfea (after an upgrade
replay or a vehicle reset). `this` is the `CarDamageFrontWing` system (CarLive+0x5c8), and fw+8 is the CarLive. Each
call does the following:

- registers `Car_FrontWing_OnCollision` twice on the car (0x1446510d0, 0x144651f90, each with `{fn, fw}`);
- fw+0x90 = CarLive+0x570, the **F1Aero** system (it is not a "car model");
- fw+0x98 = +0x98 of the ConvexHull system's (CarLive+0x5b0) entry named `"FrontWing"` (0x145bf90e8). The name map is
  at hull+0xc0 and the entries at hull+0xe8..+0xf0, and fw+0x98 is 0 when there is no such entry. It is the wing body
  that `Car_FrontWing_OnCollision` filters on, not a node map;
- fw+0xa0 = [CarLive+0x558 Chassis]+0x3f0, the second body the collision filter accepts.

Only when reset == 0 **and** the part list is empty (fw+0xb0 == fw+0xb8) does it register 11 pieces, each through
`Car_Register_DetachablePart_Thunk(fw, {predicate, fw}, &Game_Get_ModelNodeId(name), params, k)`. Then it puts the
centre predicate `{0x144660380, fw}` into the hull entry at +0xa0/+0xa8. A later Init (reset, upgrade replay) finds the
list full and registers nothing, so the pieces are registered once per car. There are three predicates, not one:

| predicate | condition (true = off) | pieces (k) |
|---|---|---|
| `Car_FrontWing_IsCentrePieceOff` 0x144660380 | k x +0x38 <= +0x48 + +0x4c | frontspoiler_fm (1.0), frontfin_fr (0.6), frontfin_fl (0.75) |
| `Car_FrontWing_IsRightPieceOff` 0x1446603d0 | k x +0x34 <= +0x4c, or +0x38 <= +0x48 + +0x4c | frontwing_fr_01 (0.25), frontwing_fr_02 (0.5), frontflap_fr (0.75), frontwingmoving_fr (0.5) |
| `Car_FrontWing_IsLeftPieceOff` 0x1446603a0 | k x +0x34 <= +0x48, or +0x38 <= +0x48 + +0x4c | frontwing_fl_01 (0.25), frontwing_fl_02 (0.5), frontflap_fl (0.75), frontwingmoving_fl (0.5) |

+0x34 is SideDetachScale, +0x38 FullDetachScale, and +0x48/+0x4c the left/right damage (`CarDamageFrontWing.h`). The
two fins use the centre predicate even though their names end in `_fr`/`_fl`. All 11 pass the same 0x70-byte params:
int 2 at +0, float 0.4 at +4, a 4x4 identity at +0x10, and 0.05 three times at +0x50.

`Car_Register_DetachablePart_Thunk` (0x144660400, L2) is a jmp into `.data1` 0x15537d4f0. Its body:

1. calls `Car_Add_DetachablePart_Thunk` (0x1446612a0 → `.data1` 0x15538e460) with (fw, cb, &id, params, k). That
   function calls `Car_Create_DetachablePart([fw+8]+0x2c8, cb, &id, params, k)` and, on success, appends the part to
   fw+0xb0..+0xb8 (cap fw+0xc0, grown through the allocator at fw+0xa8, vtable +0x18/+0x38). It returns part != 0;
2. if step 1 failed, it returns. No part exists when the car's model has no node with that id (0x143cfc8f0 returns -1);
3. otherwise it registers sub-pieces `<name>_001`, `_002`, ... (format `%s_%03d` at 0x145bf4637, with the name taken
   from the name table [0x14618ce08]+8 under the lock 0x14618ce18) with the same cb and params, until one fails. Each
   sub-piece's k is rewritten. With d = min(0.2, 2 x the distance between the sub-piece's and the main piece's node
   translations (part vtable +0x88 returns part+0x60, so the translation is part+0x90)), k becomes 1 - d when k == 1.0
   and min(0.99, k + d) otherwise. The sub-piece's +0x1f4 byte is set to 1.

The main piece keeps k as passed. V1191's transform applies to the sub-pieces only.

Part object (`Car_Create_DetachablePart` 0x144661440, allocated 0x200 bytes through the car part manager CarLive+0x2c8
{allocator, car, vector allocator, begin +0x18, end +0x20, cap +0x28}). The fields are:

- +0 vtable 0x145bf94d0, +8 allocator, +0x10 car;
- +0x18/+0x20 predicate fn/ctx;
- +0x30 k, +0x38 detached byte;
- +0x48 name id, +0x4c model node index, +0x50 `<name>_shadow` node, +0x54 `<name>_water` node;
- +0x60..+0x9f the node transform, +0xa0 shape kind (2, or 6 when the ConvexHull has an entry of that name with
  +0x70 == 2);
- +0x130 byte (0 at create), +0x1f0 float timer, +0x1f4 byte.

`Car_DetachablePart_Update` (0x1446686d0, slot 3 of 0x145bf94d0) runs every frame with dt:

- when +0x130 >= 100, or when `fn(ctx, k)` returns true, it sets +0x38 = 1 and calls slot +0xa0(part, 1), which
  detaches the piece;
- an already detached piece runs a 1.5 s timer at +0x1f0 before 0x144668830(part, 1).

So k is the predicate's multiplier. A piece comes off once the damage reaches k x the detach scale.

`Car_Create_DetachablePart` has a second caller, 0x144655640, which `Car_Chassis_Build` calls 11 times (from
0x14462b147 on). It creates parts directly in the same manager with +0x1f4 = 1. This is a second, non-front-wing part
source (L0: probably the suspension pieces), not read further.


#### Stock values and an external cross-check {#damage-check}

Stock 2025 Ferrari (`ferrari.erp`, checked by the lead): F1WingDamage SpeedThreshold 3, DamageScale 0.0001,
ChassisDamageMultiple 0.3, SideDetachScale 0.5, FullDetachScale 1. F1SuspensionDamage SpeedThreshold 7,
FrontDamageScale 0.001, RearDamageScale 0.0001, WheelDetachScale 1, PartsDetachScale 1 (raised by the reader to
1.5 = 1.5 x WheelDetachScale), LinearFractureLimit 50, AngularFractureLimit 30.

`Car_SuspensionDamage_OnCollision` (0x144654d10) is the F1SuspensionDamage impact callback: it reads the speed
threshold and the front or rear damage scale on every hit, so a live write reaches the next impact. Its corner flags go
to the matched SuspensionSystem wheel ([CarLive+0x580]+0x70..+0x88, matched by +0x2b4/+0x2b8): wheel+0x20 |= 4 for a
CAR_ collider, else 8, with the impact speed at wheel+0x24/+0x2c (gated by CarLive+0x133 bit 1 and +0x130 bit 3). The front wing
does the same in `Car_FrontWing_OnCollision`, and SideDetachScale (+0x34) is read by the visual side-broken state
(0x144631a50).

Addons can wrap it: it is the func binding `Car_SuspensionDamage_OnCollision` (signature
`car.suspension_damage_on_collision`, prototype `void(void *susp_damage, void *contact)`, experimental), at RVA
0x4654d10 on Steam and 0x464afa0 on EA (V9284 agrees). When its reset argument is 0, the system's Init 0x144653ad0
hands `{fn, this}` (lea at 0x144653bb6) to the listener remove thunk 0x1446510d0 (body 0x155338ff0) and then to
`Car_Collision_AddListener` 0x144651f90 (body 0x155339950), which work on the 15 `{fn, ctx}` slots at CarLive+0x9db8. `Car_Collision_Dispatch` calls each slot as `fn(ctx, &contact)` at 0x14473fd28, between
EnterCriticalSection and LeaveCriticalSection on [CarLive+0xf0], and ignores the return. So `susp_damage` is the
F1SuspensionDamage system (CarLive+0x5d0, its +8 is the CarLive) and `contact` is the dispatcher's stack record: +0
CarLive, +8 the car's own hit body, +0x18 contact point pointer, +0x20 normal pointer, +0x30 the other collider (dword
tag `CAR_` for a car), +0x38 the f32 that the front or rear damage scale multiplies, +0x40 a byte.
`Car_FrontWing_OnCollision` is registered and called the same way.

Will (william09leo, author of Heavier Damage) shared private findings from a live front wing damage test addon. They
agree with this map on the data vtables of F1WingDamage, F1SuspensionDamage, FuelECU, Engine and EnergyRecoverySystem,
the 4-slot data class, the data object at system+0x18, the XOR pair layout, the wing and suspension damage fields, the
1.5 clamp and the ERS Common field order. His in-game test saw the game write the VTF values back into the wing
objects, sometimes for one car and sometimes for all 22: that matches the reset path in #vtf (a single-vehicle reset
request, and the resettle of every car), which T120 pins down.

### AI {#ai}

AI cars run the same VTF, the same radUpgrade replay and the same Car_Physics_* step. No AI grip, power
or drag multiplier keyed to the difficulty slider exists as a string, VTF key or reader. The AI-only
physics knobs found are all data:
- BrakeECU (2025 Ferrari): `ASCStrengthForAI` 0.0, `ASCMaxBrakeAI` 0.5, `ASCMinYawRatioAI` 0.25,
  `ASCMaxYawRatioAI` 0.75 (active stability control for AI cars; strength 0 = off) next to the player
  ASC keys `ASCStrengthOnFullATC`/`ASCMaxBrake`/`ASCMin/MaxYawRatio` (+ Wet variants), and
  `BrakeMigrationTorqueAI` 450. Reader `Car_Read_BrakeECU` 0x1446752f0 (sites 0x144675c7f,
  0x144675cb3, 0x144675947), car-c's struct.
- Tyre: `SlipRatioMinLimitAIDegrees` / `SlipRatioMaxLimitAIDegrees` (-90/90) read by
  `Car_Read_SuspensionSystem` 0x1446aa090; the reader also asks for `WetnessDownslopeFactorAI`
  (0x1446ab322) and `SpeedDownslopeFactorAI` (0x1446ab350); the 2025 VTF carries only the non-AI `WetnessDownslopeFactor` / `SpeedDownslopeFactor` (0.1), so the AI variants take their defaults.
- Simulation rate: `Vehicle.FineUpdateRateAI` and `Vehicle.TyreContactSubStepCycleAI` read by
  `Game_Read_VehicleConfig` 0x14463a800 (AI cars sub-step the tyre contact less often).
- Career: `difficulty_mass_adjustment_scalar` (RnDDepartmentConfig +0x94, enable +0x98, read by
  `Career_Load_RnDTweakables` and 0x140a36730): the only AI-vs-player mass handicap.
- Scenario rules: 0x14139d600 (`Car_Parse_ScenarioRules`, L1) parses rule rows with `ai_level` +
  `vehicle_mass`, distance-based `difficulty_at_min/max_distance` + `vehicle_mass_at_min/max_distance`
  (min_distance/max_distance), `wetness_grip_scale`, `restrict_damage_option`, `trigger_once`, `vo_line`:
  scripted (story/challenge) AI level and car mass by gap to the player. Consumer not reached.

### Career side: fitting upgrades to a rating (Car_Fit_UpgradesToRating) {#fit}

Correction (car-d, 2026-10-28): the "car pointers" and "attribute elements" below are the career Upgrades object's
upgrade trees (`CarPerfVehicle.h`), not a physics array; the physics change comes from the `radUpgrade*` block replay
(see #perf).
`Car_Fit_UpgradesToRating` (0x143514670, cxx `game::upgrades::EngineSuppliers::fitUpgradesUpToRating(const Upgrades&, const DepartmentData&, DriverStatId)`) is the anchor. Fully data-driven, no fixed-4:
1. Walks the Upgrades robin_hood map (`[upgrades+0x38]` ctrl / `[+0x40]` slots, gate `[upgrades+0x48]`). Each slot is an upgrade GROUP (gate `[group+0x190]`); inner robin_hood map at `[group+0x180]/[+0x188]` yields upgrade ITEMs.
2. For each item it collects, from `DepartmentData.effect_defs` (inline `void*[0x180]` at dept+0, count at `dept+0xc00`), the `UpgradeEffectDef`s whose `dept_group_enum` (+0x7c) == the group byte `[group+0]` and `item_group_enum` (+0x72) == the item byte `[item+0]`. Grouping is `==`, never index-into-array[4].
3. Rating lerp: sums `UpgradeEffectDef.effect_value` (+0x64) over the matched set; ratio drives `min=[item+0x10]`, `max=[item+0x14]`, cap `[item+0x18]` (the upgrade/bound object's rating bounds). A sub-pass splits by the byte at `[effdef.variant_tag_ptr-8]` (0/3/6). Logs on channel "UPGRADES/V" (hash 0x6a15fc5f).
4. Write-back: owner = `*(upgrades+8)` (team/engine-supplier). For each car pointer in owner `[+0x298 begin .. +0x2a0 end]` (stride 8): if `*(veh+0x1960)!=0`, iterate `count=*(veh+0x1960)` attribute elements at base `veh+0xd10`, stride **0xc40**. Each element holds a fitted-effectdef pointer list (list at element+0x000 cap 0x180, count at element+0xc00); `Car_Find_Qword`(thunk 0x1449e2850, a SIMD std::find-over-qwords into .data1 body 0x1562c20a0) searches it for the current effect-def. `Car_Apply_UpgradeToVehicle` (0x1435173e0) then applies: reads the attribute via `Car_Read_VehicleAttribute` (0x14351df60) and stores results into `UpgradeEffectDef+0xa4/+0xa8`; `Car_Reset_LastFittedUpgrade` (0x143517d80, `resetLastFittedUpgrade`) runs per fitted attribute.
   Hook sites: `site_Car_AttrArrayIter` (0x143514c50, r12=CarPerfVehicle, r14=effect-def) and `site_Car_AttrArrayBase` (0x143514c64).
`Car_Aggregate_UpgradeStats` (0x1409e3fb0; decompiled at entry 0x1409e6000) is a second consumer that re-reads `upgrade_type` + `bhp_adjustment`/`mass_adjustment` by name — string-driven, not a dept[4] index.
No static callers of the apply path (indirect/encrypted dispatch); role proven by the in-binary pretty-function string (`s_Upgrades_FitUpgradesUpToRating`) + decompiled data flow.

## Changing handling from an addon {#addon}

Ranked across the lanes. Each system section above has its own detail (#addon-object, #addon-chassis, powertrain and
setup notes).

1. **Edit the VTF or VCMPD before load.** Every create, reset and upgrade replay reads from the parsed resource, so a
   change there reaches every car built from it, with no obfuscation and no re-init. Upgrade blocks scale with R&D
   progress. Equal-performance cars read the base VTF instead.
2. **Write the live systems after `site_Car_LiveCarBuilt`** (one hit per car; rdi = CarLive), or walk
   `g_Sess_VehicleTable`. Plain fields take effect on the next step. `CarObfFloat` fields need the live key. Derived
   values need the owner re-run with the right flag combination (each Reset gates on its system bit first): Engine
   Init (vt+0x30) or Reset 0x10|..., GearBox Reset 0x20|... (0x220), F1Aero OnReset 0x80|... (0x80 / 0x80|0x2200),
   Chassis OnReset(0x200), `Car_BrakeEcu_ApplyBias`, the suspension recompute 0x1446b1ba0, or the system's vt+0x18(-1). Any
   reset re-reads the VTF and any upgrade replay runs Reset(0x20bd) on every system, which also forces fuel mode
   Standard and sets lift/drag scale back to 1.0: re-apply after both.
3. **Hook a reader** (`Car_Read_<X>`, data vtable +0x10). It runs for the base section and each upgrade block
   (check `g_Car_UpgradeLerpActive`), and is shared by every car: filter on the system's car at +8.
4. **Hook the step** at the `site_Car_*` sites (engine drive torque, ERS gear modifier, fuel flow and mass, aero
   downforce/lift/drag stores, tyre grip scale), or swap a car's per-phase `{fn, ctx}` callbacks at
   +0x4f8..+0x528 (data writes, per car). Never hook `Car_Tyre_UpdateWear`: 0x1409d5443 holds an XOR-masked lea of it
   (looks like an integrity table); change wear through the data (UpgradeWearFactor, CarTyreState +0x80/+0x84).
   Hooks on `Car_Physics_StepVehicle` miss cars on the vt+0x18 substep path (byte 0x146ce89d8 != 0 or
   CarLive+0x128 == 1). `.data1` bodies (the `_Thunk` targets, and the bodies of the F1Tuning, FuelECU, GearBox, Turbo,
   WheelProxies and DebugSystem factories, which are 5-byte jmps) are not hookable.

Per car and team: a system's car is at +8, `CarLive.vehicle_id` (+0xe8) indexes `g_Sess_VehicleTable`, and the
participant link is likely `EntrantRecord+0x82` (T121). No pointer from CarLive to the AI config or VehicleIdentity was
found yet.

## Runtime tests {#tests}

Filed by the 2026-10-28 lanes; the lead ran them in one Grand Prix session on 2026-10-28 (results in #runtime and in
each test file):

- T112 (partial): does `Car_Upgrades_ApplyToVehicle` replay each block once per car build, and with what perc for a career car.
- T113 (pass): when `Car_Setup_ApplyTuning` runs, for which cars, and which slider block it reads.
- T114 (not exercised, no setup change): setup slider +0x44 / +0x48 are brake pressure / bias.
- T115 (partial): the F1Aero front and rear body lift stores (+0x19f0 front, +0x19ec rear; coefficients, not forces).
- T116 (deferred): F1Aero +0x19a8 is the DRS wing-open fraction.
- T117 (partial): CarTyreState +0x88 is the tyre wear UDP reports.
- T118 (pass): live Chassis mass after R&D weight reduction.
- T119 (pass): when a CarLive is built and torn down (session load, restart, flashback, garage).
- T120 (pass): which actions take the VTF reset path.
- T121 (partial): `vehicle_id` vs participant index, and its stability.
- T122 (pass): Engine rotation_rate and throttle at the drive-torque site.
- T123 (deferred, no driver): who calls `Car_FuelEcu_SetMode_Thunk` for the MFD fuel mix.
- T124 (pass): fuel mass burn per step.
- T125 (partial): `ers_mode` follows the MFD ERS mode.
- T126 (answered): which Bink audio track ids the recap video opens in English (#runtime).

Still open statically: who sets the CarLive +0x130 damage bits, what reads `performance_tier` in physics, how the AI
difficulty slider is applied, the TC/ABS toggle reads, the Turbo pressure update, ERS harvest, the diff torque code,
where career PU wear is loaded into the Engine wear fields, the Steering consumers, the spring/damper/ride-height
consumers, the tyre temperature model, the full VCMPD runtime layout and compound switching.

## Runtime (2026-10-28) {#runtime}

One session on the Steam build (d873a1c8), run by car-lead: profile `cartrace` with only the trace plugin (11 hooks,
all installed, none rejected; the plugin's first real-game run), a new Grand Prix (F1 2025, Ferrari/Leclerc,
Australia, race only; the game took the idle player's car over and the AI drove it), the podium, back to the menus,
then the start of Braking Point 3 (the recap video). Two gdb snapshots of every car (on the grid, about 40 s into the
race) and a Bink trace ran beside it. Evidence: `re/traces/T112..T126/2026-10-28-gp/` (each has a RUN.md).

Lifecycle of the cars:

- **Built once, at load.** 21 CarLive objects for a 20-car race: ids 0..20 in create order, each registered
  (`site_Car_RegisterVehicleId`) right before its build (`site_Car_LiveCarBuilt`). Ids 0..19 have 23 systems and
  handling version 8. Id 20 is the safety car: 1734 kg, no ERS, 20 systems, handling version 1. Nothing rebuilt a car
  during the race (T119, T121).
- **Two all-vehicle resets during loading.** About 4.3 s after the build, the all-vehicles reset 0x14f824410
  (`Car_Systems_Reset_Thunk` called at 0x14f824536) re-read the VTF into the 20 race cars (not the safety car) twice,
  half a second apart (outer callers 0x1436ab400, then 0x142d5b70e). After each one every race car got the tier block
  `medium` (perc 1.0) through `Car_Upgrades_ApplyToVehicle` and a `Car_Setup_ApplyTuning` (return 0x142f44bf5) (T120,
  T112, T113).
- **Per-vehicle reset on a controller change.** `Car_Reset_VehicleSystems` ran for id 19 three times, at load (just
  before the all-vehicle resets), around the race start and around the finish, always from the controller-change body
  0x1519eb350 (return 0x1519eb3e9). That matches the game handing the idle player's car to the AI and back, so id 19
  is most likely the player's car. Each reset replayed `medium` and ApplyTuning (return 0x142f44f83) (T120).
- **Upgrades after a reset.** The applied-upgrade vector (CarLive +0x4c0..+0x4c8) was empty before every replay, and
  `site_Car_UpgradeSectionApplyCall` never fired, so `medium` changed no section in this session. No `radUpgrade`
  blocks in a Grand Prix: the career part of T112 needs a career session.
- **Setup.** Besides the reset paths, `Car_Setup_ApplyTuning` ran once for each race car at the first setup apply
  (return 0x140c0ab84) and 5 more times for id 19 (return 0x140c0a63a) around the race start, finish and menus,
  alternating the slider block (setup+0x158 = 0, then 1). Two setups show up: the AI one (brake pressure 1.0, diff
  on-throttle 0.456) and id 19's own (pressure 0.97, diff 0.189, 10 kg fuel in the first apply) (T113).
- **Torn down at session end.** 21 `site_Car_VehicleTableRemove` hits, the count going 20 down to 0 (the last car
  leaves first) (T119).
- **Not exercised:** session restart, flashback, return to garage, reset-to-track (`Car_Physics_ResettleVehicles_Body`
  stays L1), DRS, a setup change, the MFD fuel and ERS modes. The only `Car_FuelEcu_SetMode_Thunk` calls were on the
  safety car through the pose path (mode 2, then 1).

Live values read from the snapshots: Chassis +0x150 mass includes the fuel (803 + 13.217 = 816.21 kg) (T118); fuel
mass falls during the race (13.217 to 12.766 kg for car 0) and fuel flow is non-zero on throttle (T124); engine
418.9 rad/s idling, up to about 11600 rpm, throttle 0..1, gear index live (T122); ERS mode 1 or 2 on AI cars, 4 MJ full
store (T125); F1Aero +0x19f0 / +0x19ec are lift coefficients and +0x19e8 the drag force (T115, #f1aero); tyre wear
+0x88 rises during the race (T117). `is_ai` (+0x124) read 1 for every car, the player's included: it selects the AI physics
rate, but it is not a confirmed "AI-controlled right now" or "AI entrant" flag; never use it to pick the player.

Bink audio tracks (T126, the Korean patch question): `videos/2025_recap/F125_cinematic_recap.bk2` reports 30 track
ids, index → id 0 → 10, 1..8 → 11..18, 9..17 → 20..28, 18..29 → 40..51. The game reads ids from several callers; the
pair 0x143f8b46c then 0x143f8b54c walks indexes 0..18 only. With the game in English it opened index 9 (id 20), index
0 (id 10) and index 18 (id 40) (final opens from 0x143f8b5d2). Reading: id 10 is the always-on bed and id 40 the
English voice track, so the other languages sit in ids 11..28; what id 20 carries is not known. The language → id
table is in the selector around 0x143f8b46c..0x143f8b5d2 (decompile it for the Japanese and Korean ids). A core hook
on BinkOpenTrack can swap the requested index for the one holding id 40. The UI wipe videos have one track (index 0,
id 0).

## Live physics / telemetry vehicle {#live}

`Sess_Veh_UpdateWheelMap` (0x142e90560, session lane) walks the manager's per-vehicle list `[mgr+0x110 ..+0x118]`
(`CarVehicleManager.h`). Each item's `+0x20` is the chassis-runtime component (`CarPhysicsRecord.h`), and that
record's `+0x58` is the `CarLive`. So `[[[veh+0x20]+0x58]+0xe8]` is `vehicle_id` (the old `CarWheelState` reading of it
as a tyre-set index was wrong; that struct is folded into `CarLive.h`), and `[[[veh+0x20]+0x58]+0x580]` is the
SuspensionSystem with the four wheels at +0x70/+0x78/+0x80/+0x88 (RL, RR, FL, FR; see #suspension). The four
averaged wheel floats at `wheel+0x88` feed the robin_hood map<u8,float> at `mgr+0x148`; the 26th entry triggers the
32 → 64 rehash in the B26h heap abort. The per-vehicle item's telemetry region `+0x9c70..+0x9ca8` (0x78-stride record
vector at +0x9c90) is unmapped.

## Vehicle package row {#vehicle-package}
`Game_Read_VehiclePackageRow` (0x142504a90, game lane) parses `entrants.vehicles.vehicle_N` into
`VehiclePackageRow`: stat_id (+0, init 0xff), strings (+0x08 resource_path, +0x18 specialisation, +0x28
blob_shadow_decal, +0x38/+0x50 asset groups / ai_package_folder / driver_animation_set), and performance-
relevant flags +0x60 has_cockpit_halo, +0x61 is_story_vehicle_package, +0x62 is_equal_performance_vehicle_package,
+0x63 is_26_aero_regulations. Caller is plaintext .data1 code at 0x14cca1269.

## Attribute unit-type vocabulary (career upgrade types)
`k_Car_AttrUnitTypeNames` (0x14564a168) is the ordered unit-type name blob: EnginePower, FuelConsumption,
ChassisWeightRedistribution, ChassisWeightReduction, FrontDownforce, RearDownforce,
ControlElectronicsDurability, EnergyStoreDurability, GearboxDurability, InternalCombustionEngineDurability,
MotorGeneratorUnitHeatDurability, MotorGeneratorUnitKineticDurability, TurboChargerDurability (Drag, Brakes,
TyreWear, DRS, GeneralMaintenance strings nearby). This is the `affect_on_vehicle_unit_type` vocabulary. The
R&D DB model (gamedb) exposes these via `upgrade_type_metadata` with `bhp_adjustment_fully_upgraded`,
`mass_adjustment_fully_upgraded`, `performance_rating_base/fully_upgraded`. `g_Car_AttrDef_EnginePower`
(0x145650168) is EnginePower's AttributeDefinition dispatch table.
NEEDS RUNTIME TRACE (L3): the exact attribute-NAME -> attribute-array-ELEMENT-index mapping and attr_count.
The name->small-int resolution is the FNV unit-type switch near 0x14353a700 / 0x1417f8311 (per scratchpad);
reading `attr_elem`'s header fields and which element each unit type lands in needs a live session trace.

## Older catalog (pre-campaign, game lane L1) {#older}

Kept for the function pointers it lists; the sections above supersede its claims.

### Setup / suspension / physics rig (existing game-lane L1, performance-relevant)
- `Game_F1CarSetupDataManagerBase_DeserialiseBindings` 0x140c0c0c0 — car setup (aero/suspension/gears/brakes) bindings deserialise.
- `Game_Read_VtfSuspensionSystem` 0x1446aa090, `Game_Read_VtfFloat` 0x14464e760 — VTF physics parameter readers (Chassis COMY/COMZ, Tyre/TyreRadius, Suspension Camber/RideHeight/LocalRestPosition).
- `Game_Build_SuspensionRig` 0x14462d090, `Game_Find_SuspensionNodes` 0x14475c9a0, `Game_Find_WheelNodes` 0x14462bc90, `Game_Create_CarPartProxies` 0x144635360 / `Game_Create_CarPartProxy` 0x144636150.
- `Game_Setup_FrontendCarFromVtf` 0x1428fe140 — cosmetic (visual height/camber on a render node), not physics.
DB keys: car_setup, SetupData, GearRatio, differential, brake_bias strings exist (gamedb) — setup is data-driven.

### Tyre / ERS / fuel / engine / damage surfaces (catalog; mostly existing game-lane L1)
- Tyre: `Game_TyrePerformanceRuleManager_*` (0x1415291c0 OnSpectatorChanged, 0x14152a9f0 OnSectorCrossed, 0x14152ad40 OnAWSPanelOpened, 0x14152adf0 OnPitted, 0x14152aec0 OnTerminalDamage); `Game_TyreAllocationComponent_Ctor` 0x140d055b0 / `_SendNetMessage` 0x140bd1ac0; `Game_HudTyrePerformanceViewModel_SetToOpen` 0x14152b5f0. Strings TyreModel/TyreTemperature/tyre_temperature/tyre_wear present.
- ERS/fuel/engine: strings FuelMix/fuel_mix, ers_mode, EngineMode, PowerUnit, EnergyStore*, EngineWear present (VM/config keys); no dedicated function pinned yet — candidates for a decomp+trace pass.
- Damage/reliability: strings DamageComponent, vehicle_damage, reliability present; `Game_VehicleResetToGarageComponent_Trigger` 0x142f33d80. Not yet decompiled.

### Open / needs runtime verification
- attr-name -> attr-array-element index map and attr_count (L3 trace at site_Car_AttrArrayIter).
- live-vehicle per-wheel float semantics (temp/wear/load) and the +0x9c90 telemetry record layout.
- tyre wear/temperature, ERS deployment/energy-store, fuel-mode, engine-mode, damage/reliability writer functions (decomp from the component ctors + the live physics child at [veh+0x20]+0x58).

Peak falls with load (C5 front 2.372 at 0 N, 1.199 at 15000 N).

- 2026-10-22 15:19 vmknolle: Obfuscated physics numbers (vmknolle): at runtime VTF spline samples and many handling coefficients are stored XOR-obfuscated as two u32s 8 bytes apart (value = a ^ b), e.g. Car_Spline_EvalObfuscated 0x142e88290 and the aero coefficients at F1Aero +0x1718/+0x1720 in Car_Physics_StepVehicle 0x1446dceb0. Addons that read or patch handling values in memory must decode/encode the pair; editing the VTF data before load avoids this. Aero outputs: front downforce F1Aero +0x19ec, rear +0x19f0, drag force magnitude +0x19d8; wing damage factors +0x1998 (rear) / +0x199c (front).
- 2026-10-25 02:08 vmknolle: vmknolle 2026-10-25: Car_FrontWing_Init (0x14465f620, FrontWing vtable slot at 0x145bf90d0) and Car_Register_DetachablePart_Thunk (0x144660400, 11 call sites 0x14465f898..0x14465fd58 in FrontWing init) are used by the addon Parts Detach (WRAP on FrontWing init, then more Register_DetachablePart calls on the same front wing with own predicates). Evidence for L2: the stock predicate 0x144660380 is threshold*fw+0x38 <= fw+0x48+fw+0x4c (max, left, right damage); 0x144660400 -> 0x1446612a0 -> 0x144661440 creates the part (0x200 bytes, vtable 0x145bf94d0) in car+0x2c8 and appends it to fw+0xb0..+0xb8, nothing when the model has no such node; part update 0x1446686d0 calls fn(ctx, part+0x30) every frame. Runtime 2026-10-25 (Melbourne, 22 cars): 5-9 extra parts registered per car, all came off on demand. Please raise both to L2 and verify (needed for the binding export).
- 2026-10-28 car-lead: merged the four lanes of the car-struct campaign into this map. Corrections to the lines above: front body downforce is F1Aero +0x19f0 and rear +0x19ec (the 2026-10-22 note has them swapped, see #f1aero); `CarWheelState` (CarPhysicsRecord+0x58) is CarLive, so its +0xe8 is vehicle_id (see #live); the R&D "attribute array" at +0xd10 is the career Upgrades object's tree list, not a physics array (see #perf).
- 2026-10-28 13:24 car-re: 2026-10-28 car-lead: live curve edits must write a spline's baked sample table (+0x98, value ^ +0xa0, count-1 at +0x90), not its point list (+0x8..+0x10): Car_Spline_EvalObfuscated reads the point list only when +0x90 < 0, and the loader 0x14466d250 bakes the points at load. cars::live engine and aero curve writes go to the baked table. Front wing piece detach: Car_FrontWing_IsLeftPieceOff / IsRightPieceOff / IsCentrePieceOff (0x1446603a0 / 0x1446603d0 / 0x144660380) read SideDetachScale and FullDetachScale per piece.

They landed at L1 in this lane with the contributor's evidence and notes kept; evidence is in the rows' evidence/notes columns and verify.tsv V1190 (agree), V1191 (agree). Raising them is the car-re owner's call.
- 2026-10-28 15:50 car-re: 2026-10-28 car-re: verify.tsv V ids repeat. The 82 contributor verify rows that landed with PRs #446 to #453 (as #464; verifiers verify-a to verify-f, dated 2026-10-28) are labelled V1015 to V1191, and those numbers were already in use: 90 V numbers in that range now label two rows each (the other row is from ce-verify-*, laneS-verify, fuel-verify, car-v2 and others; V1153 to V1160 were doubled before). The V number is a label in the notes column, not a key, and existing rows are not renumbered. For a row in that range, cite it by date, verifier and item (for example '2026-10-28 verify-f 0x144660400') instead of the bare V number. Existing 'per V####' cites in that range may mean either row.
