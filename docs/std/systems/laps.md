title: Laps
description: The lap files the core records in Time Trial, and the two events around writing one.
---

# Laps

While Time Trial boards are on, the core records every completed Time Trial lap to a file under `laps/` in the launcher's data folder. When the core can't write the data folder, the file goes under `swofty/laps/` in the game folder instead. An addon reads those files, adds a section to one before it is written, or reacts when one lands.

The recorder runs when the launcher writes `"tt_boards": true` into `swofty/tt.json` and the session is a Time Trial. It samples the player's car at 60 Hz. A lap starts at a line crossing and ends at the next one. The lap out of the garage is not recorded. A lap is dropped when the car is reset or moved, when the session ends, or when it is too short or too long to be a lap.

On the build the core's lap offsets are from, the core also hooks the game's own lap record (`Sess_LapTimes_ReportNewLapTime`). A completed lap then waits up to two seconds after its line crossing for the game's lap result and, when the lap is valid, for the ghost blob the game commits on a personal best. The file is written when both have arrived or when the two seconds have passed. When the hook is not available the file is written at once and the lap's time comes from the clock. The ghost blob comes from the one hook on the game's personal best commit, a byte-scan hook of the in-game boards code that is armed whenever `tt_boards` is on, with or without `tt_bridge`. `SWOFTY_LAP_GAME_RESULT=0` turns the lap result off and `SWOFTY_LAP_GHOST=0` the ghost blob.

## The file

A lap is one file, `laps/20261110T041011Z-3.swlap`: the UTC time it was written and the lap's number in the session. It is written as a `.tmp` file and renamed. A write that fails in the data folder goes to `swofty/laps/`, and the loader log names the folder and the Windows error code of the failed write. The launcher collects laps from both folders. On an EA app copy under `C:\Program Files\EA Games` the game can't create files in `swofty/`.

```
0   8   magic  "SWLAP\0\1\0"
8   4   u32 header length
12  n   header, JSON, UTF-8
..      sections: 4-byte tag, u32 length, bytes
          "SMPL"  u32 count, u32 stride, then count * stride bytes
          "GHST"  the game's own ghost blob for the lap, when there is one (1 to 131072 bytes, copied verbatim)
          "ATST"  an attestation, appended by a laps.sealing handler
          "END\0" length 0
```

Numbers are little-endian. A reader skips a section whose tag it does not know.

The header names what the core knows and leaves out the rest:

```json
{
  "format": 1,
  "core": "1.8.38",
  "game_build": "<exe sha256>",
  "board": { "content": "swofty.swofty-2022/f1_2022", "track": "bahrain", "weather": "dry", "content_name": "Formula 1 2022" },
  "car": { "team": "game/mercedes", "vehicle": "game/mercedes_2025", "driver": "game/russell",
           "team_stat": 4, "vehicle_stat": 17, "livery_stat": 0 },
  "lap": { "time_ms": 91234, "sectors_ms": [29001, 31002, 31231], "valid": true, "source": "game", "lap_index": 3,
           "started_utc": "2026-11-10T04:10:11Z", "session_time_s": 412.5 },
  "assists": { "brk": 1, "abs": 1, "trc": 2, "drl": 0, "gbx": 3, "ers": 1, "input": 2 },
  "performance": "equal",
  "rate_hz": 60,
  "fields": [
    { "name": "t", "type": "f32", "unit": "s" },
    { "name": "px", "type": "f32", "unit": "m" },
    { "name": "gear", "type": "i8" }
  ],
  "nonce": "<the value of tt_nonce in tt.json>"
}
```

`lap.source` is `game` when the time is the game's own lap record and `clock` when the recorder measured it between two line crossings. `lap.valid` and `lap.sectors_ms` are present when the game's record gives them. The core takes the game's record only when the lap time is finite and between 5 seconds and 1 hour, every sector is positive, and the sectors add up to the lap time within 10 ms when the lap and all three sectors are valid. A record that fails these is logged and the lap's time comes from the clock.

These keys are left out when the core could not read them:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `lap.session_time_s` | the core's telemetry session clock when the line was crossed, seconds since the session went live |
| `assists` | the raw assist bytes of the game's telemetry lap: `brk`, `abs`, `trc`, `drl`, `gbx` (3 is the game's automatic gearbox), `ers`, and `input` 0 pad, 1 wheel, 2 keyboard, 3 direct |
| `performance` | `realistic` or `equal` |
| `car.team_stat` `car.vehicle_stat` `car.livery_stat` | the game's stat ids of the player's participant |
| `board.content_name` | the title of the era box the content id names |
| `board.track_name` | the track's display name from the core's track base |
| `board.track_addon` `board.track_kind` | on a custom track, the addon id that adds or fills the track and `record` or `older`; left out on a stock track |

`board.weather` is guessed from the track wetness when the lap starts. The core has no read of the Time Trial weather setting. `board.game_board` is the last board name the game's leaderboard screen requested in the session, written when its weather matches the lap's. `ghost_id` is the base64 of the 0x30-byte id block of the last committed personal best, written on laps that carry a `GHST` section. Both keys are left out when unknown.

The ghost blob is built by the game on a personal best only, after the lap result. A lap's `GHST` section is the blob committed within two seconds of its line crossing, so a lap that is not a personal best has none.

A sample is the values of `fields`, in order, packed with no padding. `stride` is the sum of the field sizes. A reader parses samples from `fields` and nothing else, so the core adds a field without a new format number.

```cpp
const uint8_t *sample = smpl + 8 + i * stride;
float t;
std::memcpy(&t, sample + offset_of("t"), sizeof t);
```

The types are `f32`, `f64`, `i8`, `u8`, `i16`, `u16`, `i32` and `u32`. A field the core could not read in the running game is missing from `fields`.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `t` | seconds since the lap started |
| `dist` | metres driven since the lap started |
| `px` `py` `pz` | world position, metres |
| `vx` `vy` `vz` | world velocity, metres per second |
| `qx` `qy` `qz` `qw` | orientation |
| `throttle` `brake` `steer` | pedals 0 to 1, steering -1 to 1 |
| `gear` `rpm` `speed` | gear (-1 reverse, 0 neutral), engine rpm, km/h |
| `ws_fl` `ws_fr` `ws_rl` `ws_rr` | wheel spin, radians per second |
| `slip_ang_*` `slip_ratio_*` | tyre slip angle and slip ratio per wheel |
| `surf_fl` `surf_fr` `surf_rl` `surf_rr` | the surface under each wheel (the game's surface id, 255 unknown) |
| `g_lat` `g_long` | the chassis g signals |
| `drs` | DRS wing open fraction |

## Custom tracks

A track an addon adds, or a dormant stock row an addon fills, is a custom track. The core reads the session's track code against its track base (`apply::tracks::Base`, filled at boot) and writes `board.track` as:

- a stock track: the code, `bahrain`
- a custom track, kind `record` or `older`: `<addon id>:<code>`, lowercased, `swofty.tracks:ring`

The key has a colon and never a slash. The game's own season (`game/f1_2025`) and every addon season carry the key. When two rows share a code, the track number of the game's last board name picks the row. A code the base does not list, or a base that is not ready, gives the lowercased code with no `board.track_addon` and `board.track_kind`, and the core logs once:

```
[laps] track base: no track with this code; the board key is the track code 'ring' (logged once)
```

```json
"board": { "content": "game/f1_2025", "track": "swofty.tracks:ring", "weather": "dry", "track_name": "The Ring",
           "track_addon": "swofty.tracks", "track_kind": "record" }
```

The mailbox request's `board.track` carries the same key. The core takes the request's track from the board name's track number through the base's stat ids, and from the session's track when the base has no such stat id.

A board is the core's own when its descriptor is 6 or higher or when its track is custom. The request redirect and the guards use that one rule. A request for a stock descriptor on a custom track goes to the mailbox like an addon board, and with guards on a lap on a custom track in the game's own season does not reach the publisher's boards.

## The integrity module

The launcher loads one more native addon for a session in which Time Trial boards is on and the player is signed in with Discord: `swofty.integrity`, a closed-source DLL that Swofty's server publishes. The launcher fetches it from `GET /v1/tt/integrity`, checks its size and sha256, and checks an Ed25519 signature over `swofty-tt-integrity-v1\0 || version || \0 || sha256` against the public key pinned in the launcher. A copy that passes is kept under `timetrial/integrity/<version>/` in the launcher's data folder, the newest two versions. The session places it as `swofty/addons/swofty.integrity/swofty_integrity.dll` and lists it in `swofty/settings.json` under `plugins`, and the session's rollback removes it with every other placed file.

It is not an addon in any profile, the addon list, the load order or the addon set a lap is uploaded with. It is named in `loader.log` as an addon DLL and in the launcher's session log:

```
integrity: swofty_integrity.dll 2026.11.10.1 under swofty/addons/swofty.integrity
integrity module: not loaded for this session: couldn't reach https://...
```

When the offer is missing, unreachable or fails a check, the session starts without the module and the lap is written without an `ATST` section.

At `laps.sealing` the module appends the `ATST` section: a length-prefixed JSON document and a 32-byte HMAC-SHA256 of it.

```
ATST = u32 json_len, json bytes, 32 bytes mac
json = { "v": 1, "module": "2026.11.10.1", "nonce": "...", "body_sha256": "...", "time_ms": 91234,
         "values": { ... }, "db": { ... }, "modules": [ { "name": "swofty_core.dll", "sha256": "..." } ], ... }
```

`body_sha256` is the hash of the lap file before the section, `values` and `db` are the handling values and database rows read for the player's car, and `modules` lists the DLLs loaded from the game folder. The key of the MAC is held by the server.

## In-game boards

The core can show addon content on the game's own Time Trial leaderboard screen. It is off until the launcher writes `"tt_bridge": true` into `swofty/tt.json`, which it does when Time Trial boards in the game is on. It runs only on the game build the core's hook points were taken from. Each step logs one `[boards]` line, so one Time Trial session shows which steps worked.

The game names a board `LBV` + the descriptor id (2 digits) + the track (2 digits) + `D` or `W`: `LBV0605D` is descriptor 6, track 5, dry. Descriptors 0 to 5 are the game's own. Descriptors 6 and up are the ids the core assigned to addon boards. The game knows a board only if `system/leaderboard.xml` defines it.

Board definitions. When the game loads `leaderboard.xml` the core appends one copy of a stock `<leaderboard>` element per addon descriptor, per track the stock boards name and per custom track's stat id, per weather. It also appends the custom tracks' stat ids under every stock descriptor the file uses. A board name the file already defines is not added again, so a custom track on a dormant stock row whose board exists adds nothing under that descriptor. The copies get new `id` and `name` values, ids above every id in the file, and keep the template's other attributes and children. The file's line endings and quoting are kept. The core logs the template element once.

```
[boards] bridge on (tt.json tt_bridge); OnResult resolved for all five methods
[boards] board definitions armed at base+0x30daa2a
[boards] board definitions: 2918 bytes, template element LBV0001D: <leaderboard id="10" name="LBV0001D" ...
[boards] board definitions: appended 96 board(s) for 2 addon descriptor(s) over 24 track(s) (ids 41..136, 0 already defined), 12 of them for 2 custom track(s) (all addon descriptors and 1 stock descriptor(s)), buffer 2918 -> 41872 bytes
```

Requests. Five methods carry the screen's data: `GetTTLeaderboard`, `GetFriendsTTLeaderboard`, `GetBinaryDataForUser`, `AddLeaderboardEntry`, `UpdateLeaderboardEntryBinaryData`. When one names an addon board the core does not send it. It writes the request to `tt/outbox/<seq>.json` in the launcher's data folder (`swofty/tt/outbox/` in the game folder when the core can't write the data folder):

```json
{ "seq": 12, "method": "GetTTLeaderboard",
  "args": { "LeaderboardID": "LBV0605D", "Version": 3, "RangeType": 0, "FromIndex": 0, "ToIndex": 9, "TopResultCount": 3, "CrossPlay": 1 },
  "board": { "content": "swofty.swofty-2022/f1_2022", "track": "bahrain", "weather": "dry", "game_board": "LBV0605D" },
  "player": { "ghost_id": "<base64 of the 0x30-byte id block, once a personal best was committed>" } }
```

`args` holds every key of the method's argument struct the core could read. Binary data is not copied into it. The answer is `tt/inbox/<seq>.json` beside it, `{ "seq": 12, "status": 200, "body": "<JSON text>" }`. Both sides write a `.tmp` file and rename it, and both ignore files older than 60 seconds. The core deletes an answer it used. The flow tick finds the answer and gives the game's `OnResult` for that method a response with that status and body. A request with no answer after 8 seconds completes with status 504 and the body `{"Message":"The request timed out","Data":null}`. Every other request goes to the game's servers unchanged.

```
[boards] request GetTTLeaderboard LBV0605D redirected (seq 1789200100, to the mailbox, string form NeStr*@word0)
[boards] request 1789200100 GetTTLeaderboard LBV0605D written to the mailbox (412 bytes)
[boards] completion 1789200100 GetTTLeaderboard LBV0605D: status 200, 1880 body bytes, answered after 310 ms (OnResult returned)
[boards] request GetTTLeaderboard LBV0105D passes (stock board, string form NeStr*@word0)
[boards] request GetTTLeaderboard: LeaderboardID not readable as a board name (slot bytes: ...); passed through
```

Personal bests. When the game commits a personal best, the core keeps the 0x30-byte id block of the ghost's description. `ghost_id` carries it in later requests.

```
[boards] personal best committed (time word 0x3f3a1b2c): player id block 0700000000000000 ...
```

Guards. They are off. `"tt_guards": true` in `swofty/tt.json` or `SWOFTY_TT_GUARDS=1` turns them on, and the core logs `[boards] guards off: enable with tt_guards after the in-game confirmation` at arm time when they are off. The facts they use are not confirmed in the running game. With guards on, with or without `tt_bridge`, while the session's content is an addon's or the session's track is custom, the core returns at the entry of the game's remote storage upload, remote storage download and Racenet post. A lap in addon content or on a custom track does not reach the publisher's boards. With the bridge off and guards on, `AddLeaderboardEntry` and `UpdateLeaderboardEntryBinaryData` for an addon board or a custom track's board are answered locally with `{"Rank":0}` and `{}`.

```
[boards] guard: remote storage upload guard armed at base+0x2fa3de0: it returns for addon content
[boards] guard: remote storage upload skipped for addon content swofty.swofty-2022/f1_2022
[boards] guard: remote storage upload skipped for a custom track in the game's own content
```

`SWOFTY_TT_UPLOAD_GUARD=0`, `SWOFTY_TT_DOWNLOAD_GUARD=0`, `SWOFTY_TT_RACENET_GUARD=0` and `SWOFTY_TT_REQUEST_GUARD=0` turn single guards off. A step whose hook point does not resolve logs `off, needs <name>` and the rest keep running. Each kind of line is logged a few times and then goes quiet.

Online-state gate. In a session without the platform session (the launcher's offline component), the game's own Time Trial requests stop at the checks that open every online method: a missing presence record, the platform state words, the session token. The leaderboard screen then shows the Platform Client Overlay popup and no request reaches the push hook. With the bridge on, for the five Time Trial methods and a request of an addon board or a custom track's board, the core skips those checks at the start of the method, so the request is built and handed to the push hook, which answers it. Other methods and the publisher's boards keep the game's checks. The core logs `[boards] gate <method> armed at base+0x...` per method at arm time and `[boards] gate <method> <board>: online-state checks skipped (would have failed with ...)` per request.

With the bridge on, the game's rival search (inside the ghost handler's update) also counts an addon board or custom track board as online: the core logs `[boards] rival finder gate armed at base+0x...` and one `rival finder gate of handler ...` line per distinct state. The leaderboard screen is the front end's Time Trial track select, View Leaderboards; there is no in-session leaderboard entry in the game.

`SWOFTY_TT_DIAG=1` turns on a logging-only mode, with the bridge on or off: each gate with its values and caller (`[boards] diag: online-state gate of ...`), every request pushed to the game's request ring, the board file the game loaded, the account-state error handler with a short backtrace (the popup's trigger) and the ghost handler of the storage system. Nothing changes in that mode.

## Barred addons

The boards server rejects a lap recorded with a barred addon enabled. It lists them, without a sign-in:

```
GET /v1/tt/barred
{ "addons": [
  { "id": "kizikafuka.ai-drive", "name": "AI Drive", "reason": "the AI can drive your car" },
  { "id": "swofty.rich-fuel-mix", "name": "Rich Fuel Mix", "reason": "...", "below": "1.0.3" }
] }
```

An entry with `below` bars the installed versions lower than it. An entry without `below` bars every version. An installed version that is not a version is barred.

The launcher keeps the list in `$DATA/cache/tt-barred.json` and asks for it again once it is five minutes old. A launch does not wait for the server: the wrapper writes the profile's enabled barred addons from that file into `swofty/tt.json`, then asks the server on a thread of its own and writes the key again when the answer differs. With nothing cached and the server unreachable, the key is left out.

```json
{ "tt_boards": true, "tt_barred": [ { "id": "kizikafuka.ai-drive", "name": "AI Drive" } ] }
```

While the game is in Time Trial, in the menus and on track, the core paints one red line at the top of the screen. The main menu and every other mode hide it. The core reads `tt.json` again every two seconds while in Time Trial. `SWOFTY_TT_BARRED=0` turns the line off.

```
[tt-barred] Not allowed in Time Trial, laps won't count: AI Drive
[tt-barred] the present hook arms for the Time Trial barred addons warning
[tt-barred] warning shown: the game is in Time Trial
[tt-barred] warning hidden
```

The launcher's Time Trial page shows the same addons with the reason, and `swofty laps list` prints them:

```
Not allowed in Time Trial, laps won't count: AI Drive
  AI Drive (kizikafuka.ai-drive): the AI can drive your car
```

## Events

`laps.recorded` fires on the flow thread once the file is in place. `laps.sealing` fires just before, on the core's writer thread, with the file as built so far; a handler reads the body it is given and does not read game memory.

```cpp
#include <swofty/systems/laps.hpp>

using namespace swofty;

SWOFTY_REGISTER
{
    events::on<laps::events::Recorded>().after([](const laps::events::Recorded &e, const events::Context &) {
        swofty::log("lap file %s, %d ms", std::string(e.path()).c_str(), e.time_ms);
    });

    events::on<laps::events::Sealing>().before([](laps::events::Sealing &e, const events::Context &) {
        uint8_t digest[32] = {};
        hash(e.body, e.body_len, digest);
        e.add_section("ATST", digest, sizeof digest);
    });
}
```

`Recorded::valid` is 1, 0, or -1 when the lap's validity is not known. `Sealing::add_section` refuses the tags `SMPL`, `GHST` and `END\0`, and the core takes at most four sections of at most 1 MiB together. The core adds the `END\0` section after them.

The recorder logs one line per lap in `swofty/loader.log`:

```
[laps] wrote 20261110T041011Z-3.swlap lap 91234 ms (game), 5474 samples, ghost 0 bytes, board game/f1_2025|bahrain|dry
[laps] wrote 20261110T041502Z-4.swlap lap 92011 ms (game), 5510 samples, ghost 0 bytes, board game/f1_2025|swofty.tracks:ring|dry, custom track (record from swofty.tracks)
```

`[laps] timing started` carries the same board and suffix.

The hooks log as they read:

```
[laps] lap result from the game: car 0 record 3 (message lap 3) 91234 ms, sectors 29001 31002 31231 ms, lap valid, sectors 111 valid
[laps] game lap extras: assists brk 1 abs 1 trc 2 drl 0 gbx 3 ers 1, input wheel, performance realistic
[laps] ghost blob from the game: 51284 bytes
```
