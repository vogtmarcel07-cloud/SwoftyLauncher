# Linux and Steam Deck

You run F1 25 through Steam and Proton. With mods, you'll be playing single-player and offline.

## 1. Install the launcher

Follow [Installation](/guide/installation) to install the launcher with the installer or by hand.

If you use **Flatpak Steam**, the install folder must be inside `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/`.

## 2. Set the Steam launch option

1. Start Steam. You need F1 25 installed and a Proton version selected for it.
2. Open F1 25 in Steam → the gear icon → **Properties** → **General**.
3. In **Launch options**, enter this line. Replace `<install folder>` with the full path of the install folder, such as `/home/deck/SwoftyLauncher`:

   ```text
   <install folder>/bin/swofty run -- %command%
   ```

You can now start the modded game with either Steam's **Play** button or the launcher's **Play** button. To launch vanilla through Steam again, clear the launch option.

## 3. Play

1. Open **Swofty Launcher for F1 25** from the app menu, or `bin/swofty-launcher` in the install folder. The status line next to **Play** reads **Ready** when the launcher has found the game.
2. [Install your addons](/using/addons) and [mods](/using/mods), then pick a [profile](/using/profiles).
3. Press **Play**.
4. On your first Play, the launcher opens a one-time setup. Say whether your game folder holds mods Swofty didn't add, then select **I understand**. Select **Verify game files in Steam**, wait for Steam to finish, then select **I've verified, continue**. On the EA app copy, repair the game in the EA app instead.
5. On your first launch, you'll see the **Modded play runs offline** dialog. Select **Accept and launch**. For details, see [Offline play](/reference/safety).
6. The first launch after the setup can take 5 to 8 minutes. Don't press Play in Steam or the EA app while it runs.

If Steam is closed, the launcher starts it and waits for it to sign in first; see [Steam](/reference/launch#steam).

To see live logs as you play, select the arrow next to **Play** and choose **Play with console**, or run `swofty run` from a terminal.

If you see **F1 25 not found** next to the cover art, select **Locate game**, choose the folder with `F1_25.exe`, usually `.../steamapps/common/F1 25`, and select **Add and play this copy**.

To play the EA app copy, add its folder with **Add another folder…** in the game switcher and set `ea_launch_command`; see [The EA app copy on Linux](/using/game-copies#the-ea-app-copy-on-linux).

## Steam Deck

Install the launcher and set the launch option in Desktop Mode. Once that's set, you can use **Play** in the Deck's library to start the modded game in Game Mode too.

## If your game files aren't the ones Steam installed

Before a modded session builds anything, the launcher checks the game against Steam's record of the files it installed. If a file was changed outside the launcher, for example by another mod tool or a manual install, F1 25 is not started and a **Your game files have been edited** modal says how many files changed, names the first six, and lists the fix.

To fix it:

1. Select **Verify game files in Steam** in the modal. Steam checks F1 25 and puts its own copies back. In Steam, it's under right-click F1 25 → **Properties** → **Installed Files** → **Verify integrity of game files**.
2. When Steam has finished, press **Play** again.

The next launch checks the game again and continues once it matches Steam's copy.

## If the game closes as it starts

F1 25 runs one copy at a time. A copy started while another runs closes itself before its window opens.

- If F1 25 is already running when you press **Play**, the modded copy is not started and an **F1 25 is already running** dialog appears.
- If the modded copy closes itself as it starts, an **F1 25 was opened twice** dialog appears when another copy was running, and **F1 25 closed as it started** when none was.

To fix it, close F1 25, check that no `F1_25.exe` process is left (`pgrep -l F1_25`), then press **Play** once.

## If the game crashes

The session puts the game folder back to vanilla when the game exits, crash or not. If the launcher was closed first, it puts the folder back the next time it starts. See [Restoring the game](/using/profiles-and-restoring).

To read a summary of your last session, run `swofty logs`.

## Advanced launch settings

If your setup needs CPU affinity or environment variables, set them in `$DATA/config.json`. To stop the launcher from starting Steam or the EA app, add `"start_store": false` under `"launch"`.

```json
{
  "launch": {
    "cpu_affinity": "0-11,14-31",
    "env": { "VKD3D_SHADER_CACHE_PATH": "0" }
  }
}
```

You can use NixOS too. To run the latest code instead of a release, [build from source](/reference/development).
