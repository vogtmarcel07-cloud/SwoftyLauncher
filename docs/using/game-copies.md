# Steam and EA app copies

From 1.3.1, the launcher plays any copy of F1 25 you have: Steam's, the EA app's, or a game folder you add. **Play**, `swofty run`, `swofty apply` and `swofty build` use the active copy.

## Switch copies

The bottom-left of the launcher shows the active copy: its version, a **STEAM** or **EA APP** badge, and how it runs.

1. Select the game name next to the cover art.
2. Under **Play this copy**, select the copy you want. Each one shows its store, version and folder, and the active one has a check.

The launcher remembers your choice. If the active copy is uninstalled, the launcher plays the first copy it finds instead.

## While F1 25 is running

The launcher matches a running F1 25 to a copy by the folder its `F1_25.exe` runs from.

- **Stop** closes the active copy's game only.
- While another copy's game runs, the play bar says which store it's from and **Play** is unavailable. You can still switch copies, and **Switch to it** makes the running copy the active one.
- The launcher never closes a running F1 25 it can't match to the active copy.
- `swofty run --restart` closes a running F1 25 only when it's the copy being played.

## Add a game folder

1. Select the game name, then **Add another folder…**. When no copy is found, select **Locate game** on the **Play** button instead.
2. Type the folder's path, or select **Browse…** and choose it. It's the folder with `F1_25.exe`.
3. Select **Add and play this copy**.

The folder becomes the active copy. A folder with `__Installer/installerdata.xml` gets the **EA APP** badge.

## Where the launcher finds copies

| Copy | Found from |
|---|---|
| Steam | The Steam library that has app 3059520 |
| EA app on Windows | `Install Dir` under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Codemasters\F1_25`, then the Windows uninstall entries, then the EA app's download folders, then `Program Files\EA Games` |
| EA app on Linux | Added with **Add another folder…** |
| Any other folder | Added with **Add another folder…** |

An EA app copy needs `F1_25.exe` and `__Installer/installerdata.xml` in its folder.

The EA app's download folders are the `downloadinplacedir` lines in `%ProgramData%\EA Desktop\machine.ini` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Electronic Arts\EA Desktop\user_<id>.ini`.

An added folder that no longer has the game shows as **Folder not found** in the switcher, and **Play** uses the first copy found instead.

## The store starts with the game

**Play** starts the store the active copy came from:

- **Steam copy:** the launcher starts Steam and waits for it to sign in. See [Steam](/reference/launch#steam).
- **EA app copy:** the launcher starts the EA app, installs your profile into the game folder, then asks the EA app to launch F1 25. See [EA app](/reference/launch#ea-app).

To turn this off, select the arrow next to **Play** and clear **Start Steam automatically** or **Start the EA app automatically**. One setting covers both stores.

## Repair the game files

Each store puts its own game files back:

| Copy | Repair |
|---|---|
| Steam | **Verify game files in Steam** in the launcher opens `steam://validate/3059520`, Steam's **Verify integrity of game files** for F1 25. In Steam, it's under right-click F1 25 > **Properties** > **Installed Files** |
| EA app | **EA app** > **Library** > **F1 25** > **Manage** > **Repair**. The EA app has no link that starts a repair |

When files in the Steam copy were changed outside Swofty, the launch stops and **Your game files have been edited** offers **Verify game files in Steam**. See [Game files changed outside Swofty](/reference/launch#game-files-changed-outside-swofty).

An EA app copy is not checked against a list of its files. When the launcher finds files in its folder that it didn't put there, the same modal shows the EA app's repair steps instead.

## The EA app copy on Linux

On Linux, the launcher hands the EA app a launch link through a command you set. Set `ea_launch_command` under `"launch"` in `$DATA/config.json`, with `{url}` where the link goes. This example is for a script whose `run` starts the EA app in its Proton prefix and whose `wine` runs a program in the running EA app's prefix:

```json
{
  "launch": {
    "ea_launch_command": "u={url}; L='C:\\Program Files\\Electronic Arts\\EA Desktop\\EA Desktop\\EALauncher.exe'; if [ -z \"$u\" ]; then exec setsid -f /path/to/ea-app.sh run \"$L\"; else exec /path/to/ea-app.sh wine \"$L\" \"$u\"; fi",
    "ea_prefix": "/path/to/EAApp/pfx"
  }
}
```

- `ea_launch_command` runs with `sh -c`. With a link, it must reach the EA app that is already running, in the same Wine prefix.
- When the EA app is closed, **Play** runs `ea_launch_command` with `{url}` left out to start it, waits up to 90 seconds for `EADesktop.exe`, then 10 seconds more before it hands over the link. When that command exits with an error, the launch link starts the EA app instead.
- The EA app must keep running after `swofty` exits. A sandbox that ends with its parent, such as `steam-run`, needs `setsid -f` in front of the command that starts the EA app.
- `ea_prefix` is the EA app's Wine prefix: the folder with `user.reg`, or the Proton folder that holds `pfx`. Before it starts the EA app, the launcher writes the in-game loader's DLL setting there and leaves it in place. Wine reads it only when the EA app starts, so the first modded **Play** with the EA app open closes the EA app and starts it again.

Without `ea_launch_command`, **Play** on the EA app copy stops with a message naming the setting.

## From the command line

```sh
swofty game list
swofty game use steam
swofty game use ea
swofty game use "/games/F1 25"
swofty game add "/games/F1 25"
swofty game launch --vr
```

- `swofty game list` shows each copy's store, version and folder, with `*` next to the active one.
- `swofty game use` picks the active copy by store (`steam`, `ea`) or folder.
- `swofty game add` adds a folder and makes it the active copy.
- `swofty game launch` asks the EA app to start the EA app copy as it's installed, without your profile or offline play. Add `--vr` for VR.
- `--game <dir>` on any command plays that folder for one run.
- `swofty doctor` lists every copy and marks the active one.
