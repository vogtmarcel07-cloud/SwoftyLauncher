# Updating

The launcher keeps itself and Simplified for Swofty, the addon behind the **Mods** page, up to date. You update other addons and mods by installing the new version over the old one.

## Update the launcher

The launcher checks for a new launcher release and a new Simplified for Swofty release when it opens, then every minute while it's open. When either is available, **Play** becomes **Update**. The button names what will update, and the line next to it shows the versions and a link to the release notes.

1. Close F1 25. While the game runs, you'll keep the **Stop** button; **Update** appears once the game exits.
2. Select **Update**. It installs the launcher first, then Simplified for Swofty, and shows the progress on the button. Each download is checked against its release's `SHA256SUMS`. The launcher update replaces `bin/`, `loader/` and, on Linux, `share/`, and removes the `addons/` folder that launchers before 1.4.0 carried.
3. The launcher restarts on its own when the update finishes, including when only Simplified for Swofty updated. It restarts once, into the new launcher, when both updated.

If a check fails because you're offline, GitHub is down or GitHub's rate limit is reached, you can still play. The launcher checks again a minute later, or when GitHub's rate limit resets.

If one part of an update fails, the other part still installs. If the launcher update fails, you'll see the error next to **Retry update** and the old launcher files stay in place. Select **Retry update**, or **Play without updating** to play the version you have. If only Simplified for Swofty fails, **Play** comes back with the error and **Try again** next to it. An update interrupted partway is rolled back the next time you start the launcher.

Running the [installer](/guide/installation#install-with-the-installer) again also installs the latest release. It finds your install and updates it in place, or [moves it](/guide/installation#update-or-move-an-existing-install) to another folder you choose.

If you built from source or installed through Nix, the launcher can't replace its own files. A bar above **Play** names the new version and links to its release page, and **Play** stays available.

### From a terminal

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `swofty update` | Install the latest release into this copy of the launcher |
| `swofty update --check` | Only report whether a new release is available |

Restart the launcher after `swofty update`. In a copy built from source or installed through Nix, `swofty update` prints the release page to download from. `swofty update` doesn't update Simplified for Swofty; the launcher does.

## Simplified for Swofty

The launcher keeps [Simplified for Swofty](/using/addons#built-in-addons) up to date through the same **Update** button. If the addon isn't installed, the launcher installs it in the background. Your mod library and each profile's mod order stay as they are.

The launcher installs the newest Simplified for Swofty release that supports the launcher you'll have after the update. When a launcher update is in the same run, Simplified for Swofty is checked against the new launcher, and one **Update** installs both. A Simplified for Swofty release that needs a launcher you can't update to yet isn't offered; a bar above **Play** names it, and **Play** stays available. When an earlier launcher updated itself and Simplified for Swofty still has an update, the restarted launcher installs it on its own.

### Publishing a Simplified for Swofty release

These rules are for Team Simplified, who publish the addon at [TeamSimplified/simplified-swofty-addon](https://github.com/TeamSimplified/simplified-swofty-addon/releases).

- Launchers from 1.3.1 read the 20 newest releases and pick the newest one whose `compat.launcher` accepts them.
- Drafts and pre-releases are never offered.
- Launchers from 1.0.4 to 1.3.0 only read the release GitHub marks as latest.
- When a launcher from 1.0.9 to 1.3.0 can't load the latest release, its **Update** button can't update the launcher either.
- Mark a release as latest only when its `compat.launcher` accepts every launcher from 1.0.4 to 1.3.0, such as `>=1.0.4`.
- Publish a release that needs a newer launcher without marking it as latest: untick **Set as the latest release**, or run `gh release create --latest=false`.
- Launchers from 1.3.1 still find a release that isn't marked as latest.
- A release can need a launcher that isn't out yet; launchers it doesn't accept skip it until one that does is out.
- Attach the package's `swofty.json` to the release as an asset named `swofty.json`, and the launcher reads the requirement from it instead of downloading the package.
- Without that asset, the launcher downloads the package once to read its requirement and keeps it for the install.
- The `swofty.json` inside the package decides at install time.

## Addon updates

The launcher compares your installed addons with the [Addon Browser](/using/addon-browser) when it opens, then every 30 minutes. When any has a newer version that works with your launcher, **Play** becomes **Update addons** with the number of updates, and the line next to it lists them.

1. Close F1 25. **Update addons** appears once the game exits.
2. Select **Update addons**. Each addon downloads, is checked against its SHA-256, and replaces the installed one. Its switch and settings stay as they were in every profile.
3. A notification lists what updated and anything that failed, with the reason. **Play** comes back.

An addon that fails to update stays at its installed version, and **Play** comes back. The launcher tries again at the next check.

## Addons and mods

| To update | Do |
|---|---|
| An addon from the Addon Browser | Select **Update addons**, as in [Addon updates](#addon-updates). |
| An addon you installed from a file | [Install](/using/addons#install-an-addon) the new version. It replaces the addon with the same id and keeps its switch and settings in every profile. |
| A mod or track | [Import](/using/mods#import-a-mod-or-track) the new version. It keeps its place and switch in every profile. |
