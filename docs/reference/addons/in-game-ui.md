# In-game UI

An addon changes the game's menus through its manifest, which the launcher builds into the game's UI files, and through its plugin, which handles the live parts: view-model data, commands and [mixins](/reference/addons/hooking).

## Progressive Career's menus

Progressive Career adds a settings page between its Driver Career tile and the new-career wizard, and a Team HQ tab. The manifest declares both; the launcher builds their screens from the game's own settings pages:

```json [swofty.json]
{
  "id": "swofty.progressive",
  "name": "Progressive Career",
  "options": [
    { "id": "start_season", "type": "choice", "label": "Starting season", "default": "2026",
      "values": ["2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "2020", "2021", "2022", "2023", "2024", "2025", "2026"],
      "description": "The real season a new Progressive career starts in. Each new season moves on a year, up to 2026.",
      "binds": "native", "hidden": true },
    { "id": "rnd_mode", "type": "choice", "label": "R&D", "default": "real_life",
      "values": [{ "value": "real_life", "label": "Real life" }, { "value": "hybrid", "label": "Hybrid" }],
      "description": "Real life: each season's car brings that year's pace, with no R&D. ...",
      "binds": "native", "hidden": true },
    { "id": "team_moves", "type": "choice", "label": "Team moves", "default": "follow_driver",
      "values": [{ "value": "follow_driver", "label": "Follow your driver's real career" }, { "value": "choose", "label": "Choose your team" }],
      "binds": "native", "hidden": true }
  ],
  "career_setup": {
    "route": "career_wizard_driver_career_progressive",
    "title": "Progressive Career",
    "options": ["start_season", "rnd_mode", "team_moves"]
  },
  "hub_tab": {
    "name": "progressive",
    "title": "Progressive Settings",
    "options": ["rnd_mode"],
    "data_group": "f1_career_progressive"
  },
  "operations": {
    "native": [{ "dll": "native/progressive_ui.dll" }, { "dll": "native/progressive_back.dll" }, { "dll": "native/progressive.dll", "files": ["data/"] }]
  }
}
```

The plugin points the career tile at the setup page, and keeps Team HQ's R&D tab in step with the R&D option:

```cpp [native/src/ui/tile.cpp]
#include <swofty/career_content.hpp>
#include <swofty/career_wizard.hpp>
#include <swofty/mixin.hpp>

namespace content = swofty::career::content;
namespace wz = swofty::career::wizard;

constexpr const char *kGroup = "f1_career_progressive";
constexpr const char *kSetupRoute = "career_wizard_driver_career_progressive"; // career_setup.route

bool register_tile()
{
    content::add({.id = "progressive", .title = "lng_pg_career_content",
                  .description = "lng_pg_career_content_description", .data_group = kGroup, .suffix = "PG26",
                  .mode = "driver_career_progressive", .model = content::Model::f1_2026,
                  .careers = content::Career::driver});
    wz::Result r = wz::tile_route(kGroup, kSetupRoute); // the tile opens the setup page, not the wizard's first step
    swofty::log("[progressive] tile: setup page route %s", wz::name(r));
    return true;
}

SWOFTY_ADDON(register_tile)
```

```cpp [native/src/season.cpp]
#include <swofty/hub.hpp>

void hub_sync(const std::string &rnd)
{
    swofty::hub::Result h = swofty::hub::hide_rnd(rnd == "real_life");                   // no R&D tab in Real life
    swofty::hub::Result o = swofty::hub::set_option("swofty.progressive", "rnd_mode", rnd); // the tab's row shows it
    swofty::log("[progressive] Team HQ tab: R&D %s (%s), option %s", rnd.c_str(), swofty::hub::name(h), swofty::hub::name(o));
}
```

The build log has a line for each page:

```text
ui: swofty.progressive has a career setup page swofty_setup_career_wizard_driver_career_progressive: the route career_wizard_driver_career_progressive opens it from the career content select, CONFIRM opens career_wizard_season_length_select, and career_wizard_season_length_select's route back_career_wizard_driver_career_progressive opens it again
ui: swofty.progressive has a hub tab template swofty_hub_progressive for f1_career_progressive careers in 2 archive(s); its rows read view_model_data.hud_swofty_hub_progressive
```

## The ways to change the menus

- **Settings for your addon:** [`options`](/reference/addons/settings). swofty_core builds the addon's page in **ADDON SETTINGS**: each [option](/reference/addons/manifest#options) is a row, and **Left** and **Right** change its value. The launcher generates those pages from the game's own files each time it builds the profile, so most addons don't need their own screen.
- **[A new screen](#add-a-screen):** `operations.screens`. swofty_core registers it with the game's UI system.
  - **[Your options page as a screen](#use-your-options-page)**: `"page": "options"`.
  - **[View models](#view-models)**: native data and commands for a screen.
- **[Settings before the new-career wizard](#add-a-career-setup-page):** `career_setup`. The launcher builds a page in the CUSTOM SETTINGS look.
- **[Settings in Team HQ](#add-a-team-hq-tab):** `hub_tab`. The launcher builds the page of a laptop tab, and swofty_core adds the tab.
- **[A tile on the home screen](#add-a-home-tile):** a [site mixin](/reference/addons/hooking#run-code-at-an-instruction) on the home-tile builder.
- **[A change to an existing screen](#change-an-existing-screen):** [UI patches](/reference/ops/ui-patches).
- **A change to a screen's layout:** an edited [scene](/reference/ui/editing-menus), made in [Swofty UI](/reference/ui/swofty-ui).

## Add a screen

A screen starts with a `.ui` file, the raw screen data you'd find in the game's UI archives. Declare it in `swofty.json`:

```jsonc [swofty.json]
"operations": {
  "screens": [
    {
      "name": "my_page",              // [a-z0-9_], at most 64 characters, unique across the profile's addons: the screen's name and route
      "file": "ui/my_page.ui",        // the .ui file, relative to the addon folder; left out with "page"
      "flow": "flow_options",         // the flow the screen belongs to; default flow_frontend
      "anchor": "settings_container", // a game screen in the same flow: the screen registers after that screen's resource loads
      "view_model": false             // true asks swofty_core for a native view model
    }
  ]
}
```

The declaration is in the manifest because two steps need it before your plugin runs: at build, the launcher installs each `.ui` file into the game and lists it in `swofty/settings.json`; at boot, swofty_core registers each screen when its flow loads. Your plugin handles the live parts: [mixins](/reference/addons/hooking), view-model data and the screen's commands.

Run `swofty build`. It installs the file as `swofty/ui/my_page.ui` and lists it in the `ui` block of `swofty/settings.json`. When the flow loads, swofty_core registers your screen through the engine's own screen loader:

```text
[ui] registered screen my_page (flow_options) via the engine screen loader (parse returned <rc> = build job queued, position 1 of 1), attempt 1, 18432 bytes, resource 000001F2C3A40000, trigger <trigger>
```

If the engine rejects a node, `swofty/loader.log` names it and gives the reason:

```text
[ui] addon screen 'my_page' from <file>: node 'title' (index 4, class UILB) was rejected by its class (init from data returned non-zero), code <code> (0x<code>)
```

If you route to an addon screen that didn't register, the route is cancelled and the last screen reopens:

```text
[ui] route -> screen 'my_page' is not registered; route cancelled (<step>), front end kept
[ui] re-opening the last screen 'settings_container' after the cancelled route
```

A screen in `flow_options` gets the flow entry, loading region and route group an ADDON SETTINGS page gets. Its group has the routes `open`, `open_no_input`, `close` and `back`. `back` closes the screen and opens its `anchor` again (`settings_container` when you give none).

::: warning Reserved names
`swofty_settings`, `swofty_settings_<n>`, `swofty_addon_<n>`, `swofty_map_<n>` and `swofty_mod_<n>` belong to ADDON SETTINGS, and `swofty_setup_<route>` to [career setup pages](#add-a-career-setup-page).
:::

### Use your options page

To show your addon's options on a screen of their own, declare a screen with `"page": "options"` and no `file`:

```json [swofty.json]
"screens": [
  { "name": "ai_liveries", "page": "options", "flow": "flow_options", "anchor": "settings_container" }
]
```

- The build makes the page ADDON SETTINGS shows for your addon, with its rows and native view model, and names it `swofty_addon_<name>_<n>`.
- It adds the route `open_<name>` to the anchor's route group. The route closes the anchor and opens the page, as ADDON SETTINGS opens its pages.
- Back on the page returns to the anchor.
- The screen needs your addon on in the profile, and works only in `flow_options`.

Open it from the anchor with that route, for example from an event in the anchor's `.ui`:

```text
settings_container.Action.route { key: open_ai_liveries }
```

### View models

Set `"view_model": true` to request a native view model. Your screen gets one if swofty_core has one whose prefix matches the screen's name. It ships one for `swofty_addon_` pages:

```text
title                 the page title
o<k>.label            for each option k: its label,
o<k>.text             its value's text,
o<k>.value            its value,
o<k>.min, o<k>.max    and its range
```

It handles these commands to change option values:

```text
swofty_next:<addon>:<option>           next value
swofty_prev:<addon>:<option>           previous value
swofty_set:<addon>:<option>:<index>    value number index
```

A screen that needs a view model it can't get is not registered:

```text
[ui] screen my_page (flow_options) needs a view model and its view model is not attached yet; not registered, so routes to it are cancelled and the front end stays where it is
```

The [UI reference](/reference/std/ui) lists every view-model property and command.

## Add a career setup page

A career setup page shows some of your addon's options between a career content tile and the new-career wizard, in the look of the game's CUSTOM SETTINGS. It needs launcher 1.5.13 or later.

- Its home has a CONFIRM tile on the left and a category tile with the page's title.
- The category tile opens the rows page: one row per option. **Left** and **Right** change the value, and the panel on the right shows the focused option's description. Past 18 rows the page scrolls as ADDON SETTINGS pages do.
- Back on the rows page returns to the home.
- CONFIRM opens the wizard's season length step. Back on the home returns to the career content select.

List the options in `career_setup` ([manifest](./manifest#career-setup)):

```jsonc [swofty.json]
"career_setup": {
  "route": "career_wizard_driver_career_progressive", // [a-z0-9_], at most 48 characters
  "title": "Progressive Career",
  "options": ["start_season", "rnd_mode", "team_moves"],
  "next": "career_wizard_season_length_select"        // the screen CONFIRM opens; this is the default
}
```

The build adds `route` to the career content select's route group, `fe_career_dlc_select`. The route is a copy of `career_wizard_driver_career_to_f1`, the route a Driver Career tile takes to the season length step, and opens the page instead. Point your career content tile at it with the [career wizard library](/reference/std/career-wizard):

```cpp
wz::tile_route(group, "career_wizard_driver_career_progressive");
```

### What the build makes

```text
swofty_setup_<route>                 the home, a screen in flow_options
swofty_addon_<route>_<n>             the rows page, a screen in flow_options with the swofty_addon_ view model;
                                     <n> is the addon's index, as in swofty_addon_<n>

fe_career_dlc_select.<route>         closes the content select, moves to options_flow, opens the home and switches the
                                     backdrop to the CUSTOM settings scene (Customisation, Generic, Main)
swofty_setup_<route>.confirm         CONFIRM: closes the home, moves to career_season_setup_flow and opens next
swofty_setup_<route>.back            Back: closes the home, moves to frontend_flow and opens the content select with the
                                     driver_career message, as the career menu opens it for Driver Career.
                                     AutoFocus is false: the content select focuses its own tiles
swofty_setup_<route>.open_options    the category tile: closes the home and opens the rows page
<next>.back_<route>                  as the wizard's own routes leave its flow: next and the slices of its route group
                                     (career_wizard_summary, slice_gen_screen_title) transition out and the slices close.
                                     Then it moves to options_flow, opens the home and switches the backdrop as the entry
                                     route does. AutoFocus is false
```

- The home focuses its category tile each time it opens.
- Back on `next` takes the game's own back route for that step. Fire `back_<route>` there to return to the page, for example from your plugin's wizard back-route site for your data group.
- The build stops when the content select already has a route named `route`, or when `next` is not a screen in `flow_career_season_setup.erp`.

Progressive Career fires `back_<route>` from the wizard's back-route site, on the first wizard step only:

```cpp [native/src/ui/back.cpp]
SWOFTY_SITE(site_Game_CareerWizard_BackRoute, swofty::Context &c)
{
    auto route = reinterpret_cast<const char *>(c.rdx);   // the route name the game is about to fire
    // ... return unless route is "back", the wizard's data group is f1_career_progressive,
    // and its step and option stacks are empty (the first step the page opens)
    c.rdx = reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>("back_career_wizard_driver_career_progressive");
}
```

### The options on the page

- The rows change the options live, as ADDON SETTINGS does. A `native` option's value reaches your plugin through [settings](/reference/std/settings), and the launcher stores it in the profile.
- The options also show on your addon's page in ADDON SETTINGS, except `hidden` ones.
- Their values belong to the profile, not to a career. Copy them into the career's [storage](/reference/std/storage) when the career is created.
- The description panel shows the option's `description`. A choice has no description per value.

## Add a Team HQ tab

Team HQ is the career hub's laptop, the screen `laptop_container` in `career_hub_flow`. Its tabs come from the laptop's view model, which the game fills when the hub loads (`Career_Build_HubLaptop`); a `.ui` edit can't add one. A tab needs launcher 1.5.13 or later. The launcher builds the tab's page from `hub_tab` ([manifest](./manifest#hub-tab)), and swofty_core adds the tab, publishes the page's data and handles its commands.

```jsonc [swofty.json]
"hub_tab": {
  "name": "progressive",                 // [a-z0-9_], at most 40 characters
  "title": "Progressive Settings",
  "options": ["rnd_mode"],               // 1 to 6 of the addon's options
  "data_group": "f1_career_progressive"  // careers of this data group get the tab
}
```

```text
[hub] builders: Driver Career Team HQ (team_hq_container) hooked, laptop (laptop_container) hooked
[hub] progressive: tab 'Progressive Settings' for careers of f1_career_progressive, 1 option row(s) from swofty.progressive
[hub] progressive: tab 'Progressive Settings' added after STANDINGS (key 0x00c9b739, page swofty_hub_progressive, data view_model_data.hud_swofty_hub_progressive)
[hub] progressive: next swofty.progressive.rnd_mode
```

### What the build makes

The template `swofty_hub_<name>`, added to the templates of `screens/laptop_overview.ui` in `flow_career_hub.erp` and `flow_team_hq.erp`. It is the game's settings rows page on the laptop: its scene is the settings page scene `art/screens/options/options_edit_screen.idf`, and its parts are the settings screen templates from `flow_options.erp` (`screens/settings_container.ui`). Its root, with the fade-in and the button prompts, comes from the inbox page `tab_content_emails_panel`; none of the inbox's parts are kept.

```text
swofty_hub_<name>
├─ left: one settings row per option, in options order (at most 6)
│    label   #view_model_data.hud_swofty_hub_<name>.o<i>.label
│    value   ….o<i>.value, between left and right arrows; the focused row is highlighted as on the game's settings pages
├─ top right: the category box, with the page title ….title
├─ under it: the description panel, with the focused option's label in capitals as the heading
│            and its description from the manifest as the body
└─ button prompts: Adjust for Left and Right
```

- The settings screen title, category filter and scroll bar are hidden.
- The scenes the page uses, with their animations, meshes, material bindings, materials and textures, are copied from `flow_options.erp` into each archive that lacks them, byte for byte and under their own names. No stock resource changes.
- The build fails when a copied resource refers to a resource that the archive, the copies and the shared archives (`persistent.erp`, `flow_persistent.erp`) all lack, but `flow_options.erp` has.
- Up and Down move between the options. Right on option `i` raises the command `swofty_next:<addon id>:<option id>` on the template, and Left raises `swofty_prev:<addon id>:<option id>`, as on ADDON SETTINGS pages.
- The template's `shown` and `enabled` events focus the first option.
- The build checks the template against the game's UI loader rules.

```text
ui: hub tabs copy <n> settings screen resources from flow_options.erp into <archive>
```

### What swofty_core does

- Adds a primary tab after STANDINGS, for careers of `data_group`, in the career hub's laptop (`laptop_container`) and in Driver Career's Team HQ (`team_hq_container`). The tab has one sub-tab whose content template is `swofty_hub_<name>`, built the way the laptop builds STANDINGS (content `tabbing_secondary_controller`, header `tabbing_secondary_tab`).
- Names the tab with the string key `lng_swofty_hub_<name>`, set to the title in capitals.
- Publishes `title`, `count`, and `label`, `value` and `description` for each option `o<k>`, under `view_model_data.hud_swofty_hub_<name>`, and again after every change of one of its options.
- Handles `swofty_next` and `swofty_prev` raised on the sub-tab, and steps the option as ADDON SETTINGS does.

### From your plugin

`swofty/hub.hpp` controls the tab from your plugin. Its table is read only when the running `swofty_core.dll` exports `SwoftyCoreHub`, so a plugin built against it also loads on an older core and sees `unavailable`.

```cpp
#include <swofty/hub.hpp>

namespace hub = swofty::hub;

if (hub::available()) {                          // the hub tab builders are hooked
    hub::hide_rnd(true);                         // hide Team HQ's R&D tab while on
    hub::set_option("swofty.progressive", "rnd_mode", "hybrid"); // pick an option's state, as if the player did
}
hub::Result r = hub::hide_rnd(false);
swofty::log("[my-addon] R&D tab shown: %s", hub::name(r)); // ok, late, unavailable or invalid
```

- `hide_rnd(on)`: Team HQ builds the R&D tab hidden, and an open Team HQ hides or shows it from the next frame. The tab stays hidden when Team HQ shows all its tabs again. Cores before the live path leave the tab out from the next Team HQ entry instead.
- `set_option(addon, option, value)` picks the option state whose value is `value`: a choice value, `"true"` or `"false"`, or a number. It runs the same command ADDON SETTINGS runs.

```text
[hub] R&D tab hidden (hide_rnd on); an open Team HQ follows on the next frame
```

## Add a home tile

The game builds the home screen's tiles in `FeTile_Build_List`. swofty_core adds ADDON SETTINGS there: a [site mixin](/reference/addons/hooking#run-code-at-an-instruction) runs right after the game adds the Career tile, adds a copy of it, and gives the copy its own text and route. This is the code, from `native/src/core/swofty_core.cpp`:

```cpp [native/src/core/swofty_core.cpp]
#include <swofty/game.hpp>
#include <swofty/mixin.hpp>

using namespace swofty::game;

// 1. Name it.
constexpr const char *ROUTE = "mod_menu";
constexpr const char *TITLE = "ADDON SETTINGS";
constexpr const char *DESCRIPTION = "Configure the addons installed by Swofty Launcher";

void set_string(void *reg, void *parent, const char *name, const char *text)
{
    NeStr *s = nullptr;
    Ne_Make_StrFromCStr(&s, text, 0, 0);
    Vm_Set_String(reg, parent, name, &s, 1);
    Ne_Make_StrFromCStr(&s, nullptr, 0, 0);
}

// 2. Set its text: the tile's populate method fills its view-model node.
void mod_populate(HomeItem *item, void *node, uint32_t a7)
{
    FeTile_ItemBase_Populate(item, node, a7);
    auto vm_node = static_cast<uint8_t *>(item->button_node.node);
    if (!vm_node)
        return;
    void *reg = *g_Vm_Registry, *parent = vm_node + 8;
    uint8_t no = 0;
    set_string(reg, parent, "title", TITLE);
    Vm_Set_Bool(reg, parent, "title_localised", &no, 1);
    set_string(reg, parent, "description", DESCRIPTION);
    Vm_Set_Bool(reg, parent, "description_localised", &no, 1);
}

// 3. Route it: get_action returns an action of type 1, whose string names the route to open.
Action *mod_get_action(HomeItem *item, Action *out)
{
    out->type = 1;
    out->str = nullptr;
    Ne_Make_StrFromCStr(&out->str, ROUTE, 0, 0);
    return out;
}

// 4. Add the tile: append a copy of the Career tile, then move the builder's counters past it.
SWOFTY_SITE(site_FeHome_AfterCareerCall, swofty::Context &c)
{
    auto list = reinterpret_cast<TileList *>(c.r14);
    FeHome_Add_CareerTile(list, uint8_t(c.r12 + 1));
    c.r12 += 1;
    c.r15 += 1;
    HomeItem *item = list->items_end[-1].tile->item;
    // this tile gets a copy of the virtual table with slot 4 (populate) and slot 5 (get_action) replaced;
    // the other Career tiles keep the game's table
    swofty::subclass(item, {{4, reinterpret_cast<void *>(mod_populate)}, {5, reinterpret_cast<void *>(mod_get_action)}});
    Ne_Make_StrFromCStr(&item->id, ROUTE, 0, 0);
}
```

- [`swofty::subclass`](/reference/std/mixin#subclass) gives one object its own copy of its virtual table.
- Every function and struct here is in the [Game API](/reference/game/): [`fe_home`](/reference/game/fe_home), [`fe_tiles`](/reference/game/fe_tiles), [`vm`](/reference/game/vm) and [`core`](/reference/game/core).

::: tip
swofty_core already owns `site_FeHome_AfterCareerCall`. If you add a second site mixin there, it runs in the same chain, ordered by [priority](/reference/addons/hooking#chains).

## Change an existing screen

[UI patches](/reference/ops/ui-patches) describe edits to the game's screens, routes and UI databases: clone a node, set a label's text, change properties, or add or remove signals. List your patches in `operations.ui`:

```json [ui/example.pkgpatch.json]
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "targets": [
    { "erp": "2025_asset_groups/ui_package/databases.erp", "resource": "eaid://ui_package/databases/tool_tips.uidb" }
  ],
  "edits": [
    {
      "op": "clone-entry",
      "at": "tool_tips.Contents.tooltips_dictionary.Contents",
      "src": "settings_fe_home",
      "as": "sample_mod_hint",
      "set": { "Name": "sample_mod_hint", "Contents.text.Value": "Sample Mod" }
    }
  ]
}
```

::: warning Not built yet
The build skips `operations.ui` and prints a warning:

## Main menu state files

The launcher writes `swofty/home_menu.json` into the game folder at launch and rewrites it when the latest video has been fetched. The core reads it for the main menu's top-right strip and the video card. With the **Home screen video** setting off (`"home_video": false` in `config.json`) the file has no `video`, the launcher doesn't fetch it, and the home screen has no video card.

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "launcher_version": "1.8.37",
  "discord": { "signed_in": true, "name": "swofty", "avatar": "C:/users/.../multiplayer/avatar.png" },
  "video": {
    "title": "Latest video",
    "url": "https://youtu.be/abc123",
    "thumbnail": "C:/users/.../cache/home_menu/thumbnail.jpg"
  }
}
```

`avatar` is present only while signed in and the image file exists. `video` is present when the registry answered at least once; a failed fetch keeps the cached video.

The video comes from the registry's `GET /v1/video/latest`:

```json
{ "id": "abc123", "title": "Latest video", "url": "https://youtu.be/abc123",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/abc123/hqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2026-11-09T10:00:00Z" }
```

To open a link the core writes `swofty/open_url.json`, `{"url": "https://youtu.be/abc123"}`. The launcher reads and deletes it while the game runs, and opens the link in the default browser of the host. It opens only `https` links on `www.youtube.com`, `youtube.com` and `youtu.be`.

## Main menu tiles

swofty_core builds the main menu's tile list in this order: Braking Point, Career, Grand Prix, Time Trial, Split Screen, the challenge tile when the game builds it, Theatre, Showroom, Customisation, a divider, Addon Settings. The F1 World, League Racing and Player Hub tiles and the divider are not added. Grand Prix and Time Trial are copies of the F1 World item with their own id, title and description. Split Screen is the game's Local Multiplayer item (id `local_multiplayer`) with its own title and description; its stock route opens the game's Local Multiplayer list, which is the lone Splitscreen tile, and Back from there returns to the main menu. Showroom is a copy of the Theatre item that fires the `swofty_showroom` route, a copy of the F1 World hub's own `showroom` route with the hub swapped for `fe_home`: it closes only the home screen, so `slice_bg_content_underlay` and the player card stay open for the series picks, opens `fe_showroom` with its view model callback before input, and closes the theming overlay. Customisation is a copy of the Theatre item (id `swofty_customisation`) that fires the `swofty_customisation` route and opens the game's CUSTOMISATION screen: Driver Profile, Race & Casual Wear, Car and Badges.

The tiles stay in the stock vertical list at the stock position, all in the large default tile style: Theatre, Showroom and Customisation are copies of the Theatre item and, like Split Screen, take the type `fe_tile_button_default`, and the divider tile (the stock divider adder) sits before Addon Settings. A launcher build with the environment variable `SWOFTY_HOME_ROWS` set also adds a rows layout (scene slots in `fe_home.idf`, templates in `fe_home.ui`, flag `swofty/ui/home_rows.flag`); it is off by default.

```text
[main-menu] home tile block at 0x...; adders F1 World 0x..., challenge 0x..., Local Multiplayer 0x..., Theatre 0x...
[main-menu] stock F1 World, divider, League Racing, Player Hub and Theatre tiles skipped
[main-menu] the launcher's rows of cards are in this build
[main-menu] tiles added after Career: Grand Prix, Time Trial, Split Screen, Theatre, Showroom, Customisation (last index 8)
```

The Customisation card reaches the game's customisation screen without the F1 World hub:

- `swofty_customisation` is a route the launcher adds to the `fe_home` group, a copy of the home's own `customisation` route: the standard wipe, close `fe_home`, `slice_bg_content_underlay` and `fe_planes`, then `Migrate customisation_flow enter_f1_life_customisation`, which opens `customisation_f1_life_entry`. The F1 World hub's own `customisation` route closes `fe_f1_world` instead.
- Back from that screen fires a route in the `customisation_f1_life_entry` group: `back_1` (`Migrate frontend_flow enter_fe_f1_world`, which opens the F1 World hub) when the screen was opened from the hub, and `back`, which leads nowhere, when it was opened from the main menu. The launcher adds `swofty_back_home` to that group in `routes_customisation_and_store.uir`, the activity container's `home` route as the container's own `swofty_back_home` has it. After a Customisation card press the core replaces `back` (or `back_1`, or `back_2`, the screen's Back to the news) with it: Back returns to the main menu. A Customisation screen reached any other way keeps the game's Back. The press stays armed until the swap, a migration to `frontend_flow`, or `fe_home` opens; the help page some customisation screens open (`team_hq_flow`) keeps it.
- The launcher writes `swofty/ui/home_customisation.flag` only when both routes are in the build; without it the core adds no Customisation card. A build that cannot add them warns `ui: no Customisation card on the main menu: ...`.

```text
[main-menu] the launcher's Customisation routes are in this build
[main-menu] customisation card pressed (item 0x...): route swofty_customisation; the Customisation screen's Back returns to the main menu
[main-menu] nav: Migrate command: flow 'customisation_flow' entry 'enter_f1_life_customisation' -> accepted; the flow the game last accepted is now customisation_flow
[main-menu] nav: route 'back' fired in group 0x... (customisation_f1_life_entry)
[main-menu] back: the Customisation screen was entered from the main menu card; its Back (route back in customisation_f1_life_entry) returns to the main menu
[main-menu] back: the game's handler fired route back from its own view model (group 0x...); it is replaced by swofty_back_home in the same group, so the F1 World hub is never opened
```

When the home tile block does not match byte for byte, the core logs `the home tile block did not resolve on this build; the stock main menu stays` and changes nothing.

`SWOFTY_MAIN_MENU=0` leaves the stock main menu. `SWOFTY_MAIN_MENU_NAV` is logged.

The Time Trial and Grand Prix cards open the activity container without the F1 World hub:

- `swofty_time_trial` is a route the launcher adds to the `fe_home` group, a copy of the game's `home_to_activity` that migrates to the `f1_world_flow` entry `swofty_enter_time_trial`, which opens the activity container with the command `time_trial` already raised, the way the game's `enter_splitscreen_era_select` raises `ss_game_mode_select`. The Time Trial card fires it.
- The Grand Prix card fires the game's own `home_to_activity` (the plain `enter_f1_world_activity` entry) and the core raises `solo_gp` on the activity container once its tabs exist: the command the container's own Grand Prix card raises. The game answers with `grand_prix_resume`, whose route migrates to the front-end flow's `enter_gp_resume` and opens `grand_prix_continue`, the game's Grand Prix screen with the saved seasons, **Continue** and **New Grand Prix**, as F1 World > Play > Grand Prix does. The core asks the game's season lookup once (`probe:` lines) for the log only.
- Back from the container fires `f1_world` or `home`; the core replaces it with `swofty_back_home`, the container's `home` route behind the standard full-screen wipe with the theming overlay opened after `Migrate frontend_flow enter_fe_home`. Back from the Showroom fires `back_1`; the core replaces it with `swofty_home`, a copy of the hub's `back_1` in the `fe_showroom` group. Back from the saves list fires `back`, the game's migration to the activity container, and stays the game's; after a Grand Prix card press the core leaves the container for the main menu with `swofty_back_home` once its tabs exist. Before `swofty_back_home` the core sets `#ui_menu_data.frontend_transition_state` to `main_menu`.
- A Time Trial or Grand Prix session that ends hands over through `frontend_transition.ui`, whose `migrate_to_f1_world` node enters `swofty_enter_return` (the bare activity container) instead of `enter_f1_world_container`. The core raises the command of the card that started the session once the container is active, 300 ms after its own first command (`show_default`, `tab_activated`), not when its tabs are built: raised that early the game refuses the route (`The screen f1_world_activity_container is not currently active`) and the screen stays black. `time_trial` opens the Time Trial picker, `solo_gp` the saves list with the season just played.
- `swofty_grand_prix` (the activity container with `grand_prix_new`) and `swofty_grand_prix_saves` (a copy of the `theatre` route that opens `grand_prix_continue` straight from the home screen) stay in the routes and are not fired: opened that way the saves screen's slot list crashed the game in `Game_CareerContinue_ListSlots` (1.9.4).
- The core logs every `Migrate` route command (`nav: Migrate command: flow ... entry ...`), keeps the flow the game last accepted, and when a screen it asked for is not open after 4 seconds fires `swofty_back_home` (the `f1_world_flow` or `customisation_flow` is current) or the `open` route of `fe_home` (the front-end flow is current).

`SWOFTY_MAIN_MENU_ENTRY=chain` opens the pickers the old way (`home_to_activity`, then the command 900 ms after the container is up; `SWOFTY_MAIN_MENU_ROUTE` replaces the route name, `SWOFTY_MAIN_MENU_CHAIN=0` stops at the container). `SWOFTY_MAIN_MENU_BACK=stock|home|twostep` leaves the game's Back, fires the container's `home`, or takes the hub's own Back. `SWOFTY_MAIN_MENU_RETURN=0` leaves the session-end hand-over on the bare container. `SWOFTY_MAIN_MENU_RECOVER=0` turns the recovery off. `SWOFTY_MAIN_MENU_STATEFIX=0` leaves the transition state alone. `SWOFTY_MAIN_MENU_MIGRATELOG=0` leaves the `Migrate` command unhooked.

```text
[main-menu] nav: the launcher's Time Trial, Grand Prix and Back routes are in this build
[main-menu] nav: route Migrate command hooked at base+0x...
[main-menu] chain: Time Trial card pressed; route swofty_time_trial opens the activity container, then 'time_trial' is raised on it (the Time Trial picker)
[main-menu] chain: Grand Prix card pressed; route home_to_activity opens the activity container, then 'solo_gp' is raised on it (the container's own Grand Prix command: the saved seasons and New Grand Prix)
[main-menu] nav: Migrate command: flow 'f1_world_flow' entry 'swofty_enter_time_trial' -> accepted; the flow the game last accepted is now f1_world_flow
[main-menu] back: the game's handler fired route f1_world from its own view model (group 0x59ba71d1); it is replaced by swofty_back_home in the same group, so the F1 World hub is never opened
[main-menu] nav: session-end hand-over landed on the activity container (the F1 World hub was skipped); raising 'solo_gp' on it once it is active
```

While the main menu is open the overlay paints the Swofty Launcher version, the Discord sign-in state and avatar in the top right, and the latest video's thumbnail with `Press RB to watch` (`Press V to watch` without a gamepad) in the bottom right. Pressing the key writes `swofty/open_url.json`. Entering Time Trial while signed out of Discord shows the game's message popup once per session; its OK continues.

The top-right account panel and the bottom-right video card are game UI. The launcher build adds two component slots to `fe_home.idf` (`swofty_details_account` and `swofty_details_video`, copies of the `details_offline` and `details_news` slots of the "Launched with" and news cards) and two groups to `contextual_panels` in `fe_home.ui` (`swofty_account_panel` and `swofty_video_panel`, copies of `offline_contextual_panel` and `news_contextual_panel`, always visible). Their text reads `ui_menu_data.swofty_panel_text`, `swofty_video_title` and `swofty_video_prompt`, which the core sets on the flow thread.

The overlay draws only the two images: the video thumbnail inside the news card's image area and the Discord avatar beside the account panel. Positions are in scene units (the front end spans about 17.8 by 10 units), converted through the 16:9 band the front end is laid out in: the full height of a 16:9 or wider frame, and the full width of a taller one such as a Steam Deck's 16:10, centred with the game's backdrop above and below. Sizes scale with the band's height.
