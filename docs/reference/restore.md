# Backups and recovery

This page is for contributors. Players should use [Restoring the game](/using/profiles-and-restoring).

The **baseline** records original game files. The **journal** records changes so they can be undone after a crash.

## Stored files

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `$DATA/baseline/objects/<sha256>` | Original file contents |
| `$DATA/baseline/<build_id>/baseline.json` | File sizes and hashes for a game build |
| `$DATA/state/journal/<id>.json` | Changes to undo; `"session": true` for a `swofty run` session |
| `$DATA/state/placed.json` | Every file the launcher wrote into the game folder, with its SHA-256 |
| `$DATA/state/session.lock` | Held by a running session until its game files are rolled back |
| `$DATA/state/blocked.json` | Files of unknown origin that stopped the last launch |
| `$DATA/state/not-stock.json` | Game files that don't match Steam's copy, which stopped the last launch, with each file's measured path, found size, Steam's size and modified time |
| `$DATA/state/recovered.json` | The last recovery, for the launcher to announce |
| `$DATA/state/setup.json` | The one-time setup: its version, the player's answer about other mods, when the game folder was put back, when the setup finished, and whether the first-launch notice was shown |
| `$DATA/baseline-retired/` | The baselines the setup moved aside, until the setup finishes |

## Checking against Steam

Steam keeps a manifest for each installed depot in `<steam>/depotcache/<depot>_<manifest>.manifest`, listing every file's size and SHA-1. The installed depots and their manifest ids are in the library's `appmanifest_3059520.acf`. Before a session builds anything, `swofty run` and `swofty apply` check the game against them:

- Each original the baseline recorded at first sight (`"source": "first-sight"`) is compared with Steam's copy. A match becomes `"source": "depot"` and isn't compared again. A mismatch whose game folder file now matches Steam's, as after a Verify in Steam, is backed up again from the game folder.
- Until a check passes for a game build, every file Steam installed is checked by size (`"stock_checked": true` in `baseline.json` once it has). Files `placed.json` records as written by the launcher are left to the install.
- EA AntiCheat's launcher files (`EAAntiCheat.*` in the game root) are logged when they differ from Steam's and never stop a launch. EA rewrites them on a normal start. Modded sessions do not use them. Offline play parks and restores `EAAntiCheat.GameServiceLauncher.exe` through its own journal.
- Before the check, a stale `EAAntiCheat.GameServiceLauncher.exe.bak` an interrupted session left is cleared: a backup that is Steam's copy is put back over the live exe, and a backup that is not is set aside under `swofty/offline-recovery/` while a Steam-verified live exe is kept. This step is skipped while a session is pending.
- Each original the install backs up for the first time is compared with Steam's copy before it is copied.

A file that doesn't match, other than an EA AntiCheat launcher file, stops the session before anything is built or changed and writes `state/not-stock.json`. The launcher opens a **Your game files have been edited** modal that says how many files changed, names the first six, and lists the fix: **Verify game files in Steam** (`steam://validate/3059520`), or add mods through the Simplified Importer. `swofty run` and `swofty apply` print the same link. Files Steam doesn't list are not checked. A game folder outside Steam is not checked. Without a readable manifest for every installed depot, the check is skipped and the launch log says why.

## The one-time setup

Modded play waits for the setup in `swofty_core::setup`. The launcher opens it on Play, and `swofty setup` runs it from the command line.

1. The player says whether the game folder holds mods Swofty didn't add.
2. `setup::reset` takes the session lock and restores the game folder as `swofty restore` does. It then moves `$DATA/baseline` to `$DATA/baseline-retired` and deletes `$DATA/cache/overlay`.
   - When the restore fails on a Steam or EA app copy, the reset continues: `$DATA/state/journal` moves to `$DATA/baseline-retired/journal`, and a second restore against the empty record removes Swofty's own files. The wizard names the error and says verifying puts the rest back.
   - When the restore fails on a copy from neither store, the reset stops before anything moves.
3. The player verifies the game files in Steam or repairs them in the EA app. On a Steam copy, **I've verified, continue** stays off until the player opens the verify, and while Steam is verifying or updating the game. A running Steam's state comes from its `logs/content_log.txt`, since Steam doesn't update the `StateFlags` of the app manifest during a verify; the manifest covers the rest.
4. `setup::finish` records the setup as done and deletes `$DATA/baseline-retired`.

The next install records each original again as it first sees it, checked against Steam's manifests when they can be read. Raising `setup::VERSION` sends every player through the setup again. `swofty run --apply` and every install refuse to start until the setup is done. `swofty run` also refuses to start while Steam is verifying or updating the game.

## Recovery rules

Record each change before applying it. Undo changes in reverse order, including steps that may have been interrupted.

Restore replaced files from backups. Remove files and empty folders created by the launcher. Remove the Wine override added for the session.

If a file has unexpected contents, leave it alone and report it. Never restore files from an old game build over a newer one.

## Sessions

The `swofty run` wrapper holds `session.lock` from before it installs the profile until the offline play staging and the profile are rolled back. It rolls back when the game exits for any reason, on an error, and on a stop signal. A direct `swofty run` waits for the wrapper to exit and rolls back anything the wrapper left.

A session journal still open while the lock is free belongs to a session that ended without rolling back. `swofty run`, `swofty apply` and the wrapper roll back every open journal before they start. The launcher rolls back session journals when it starts, and keeps a `swofty apply` install.

## Leftovers

A file in the way of an install counts as the launcher's own when `placed.json` records those exact bytes at that path, or when it is byte-identical to the file about to be placed and not a backed-up original. The install clears those files, logs the recovery and the `swofty doctor` report, and tries once more. Any other file stops the install untouched and is recorded in `blocked.json`; `swofty restore` moves it to `$DATA/set-aside/<time>/`. The launcher opens the **Your game files have been edited** modal, whose **Restore game folder** button runs the same restore.

At start, files that `placed.json` records and no open journal covers are cleared the same way.

## Damaged state files

State files are written to a temporary file, flushed to disk and renamed over the old one. Backups in `baseline/objects` and restored originals are flushed before they take their name.

A state file that is not JSON at all (empty, zero-filled or truncated) is moved to `<name>.corrupt-<unix time>` and never deleted. Valid JSON in a shape the launcher cannot read is left in place and reported as an error.

| File | When damaged |
|---|---|
| `baseline.json` | Started over in rebuild mode (`"rebuild"` in the file) |
| A journal | Skipped; `placed.json` and the baseline clear its leftovers |
| `placed.json` | Started over empty; leftovers are reported as files of unknown origin |
| A profile or `config.json` | Started over as if missing |

In rebuild mode a game file is recorded as an original only when its bytes are already a backed-up original in `baseline/objects`. Any other file stops the install untouched with "the launcher's record of your original game files is damaged; verify the game files in Steam, then press Play again". The next install records such files at first sight. A file that `placed.json` records as written by the launcher is never recorded as an original, and `swofty verify` reports it until the game files are verified.

`swofty doctor` lists the set-aside copies.

## Commands

- `swofty restore`: restore originals and remove launcher additions.
- `swofty verify`: report remaining changes.
- `swofty doctor`: report changes and check the rest of the setup.

## Tests

`packages/core/tests/restore.rs` covers profile changes, interrupted changes and game updates using a test folder. `packages/core/tests/session_recovery.rs` covers crashed and killed sessions, leftovers of lost journals and files copied in by hand. `packages/core/tests/damaged_state.rs` covers damaged state files.

```sh
cargo test -p swofty-core --test restore --test session_recovery --test damaged_state
```
